Academic Writing in Research Paper
“In academic writing, being casual is like showing up to a black-tie event in
flip-flops and a Hawaiian shirt. It might be comfortable, but it might not impress
anyone.”

Academic writing involves using formal written English and is

typically utilized by students, professors, and researchers to communicate
their ideas in a scholarly manner. Simply put, academic writing is a type of
writing that people use to share and discuss opinions about different areas
of knowledge in academic contexts (Timyam, 2021). Academic writing has
specific characteristics that distinguish it from other types of writing (see
Table 1.1). These include a formal language style and conventions, and
particular grammatical and lexical features.

Before exploring the specifics of academic writing in research
papers, this chapter introduces how academic writing appears in other
types of academic work beyond research papers. While research papers are
a prominent form of academic writing, other types of academic work, such
as essay assignments, literature reviews, and reflective journals, also employ
academic writing conventions but may vary in style, tone, and structure. For
instance, essay assignments might prioritize argumentative structure and

critical analysis, whereas literature reviews focus on synthesizing and
evaluating existing research. Reflective journals, while still formal, might
allow for a more personal tone compared to the objective style of research
papers.

1. Language Style and Convention
Academic writing is characterized by its formal tone, objectivity, and
clarity of expression (Bailey, 2022; Giltrow et al., 2021). Unlike casual or
informal writing, academic writing requires a structured approach with wellreasoned arguments supported by evidence. In this section, we examine
the language styles and conventions commonly used in academic writing,
providing you with the essential foundation for creating scholarly work.
Academic writing involves five main elements of language style and
conventions (see Fig. 1.1), namely formal tone, objectivity, clarity of
expression, precise and specific language, and citing sources.

RESEARCH WRITING

1.1 Formal Tone
Academic writing requires a formal tone that conveys authority and
professionalism. This means avoiding colloquial language, slang, and overly
casual expressions. Instead, use formal language to maintain credibility and
respectability in your writing. For example:
Casual:

The teacher’s methods are pretty cool.

Formal:

T h e i n s t r u c t o r ’s p e d a g o g i c a l s t r a t e g i e s a re
innovative.

Explanation
In the casual example, the phrase “pretty cool” is colloquial and lacks
the level of formality expected in academic writing. This informal
expression may diminish the perceived authority of the writer and
undermine the seriousness of the topic being discussed. Conversely, the
formal example employs language that is more appropriate for
academic discourse. By replacing “pretty cool” with “innovative,” the
writer communicates the same idea using for mal vocabulary.
“Innovative” conveys a sense of creativity and originality, highlighting
the teacher’s forward-thinking approach to pedagogy. This enhances
the writer’s credibility and professionalism, contributing to a more
authoritative and respectable tone in the academic writing.

1.2 Objectivity
In academic writing, writers should maintain objectivity by
presenting information and arguments in an unbiased and impartial way.
This involves using neutral language and avoiding emotionally charged
language that could influence readers’ perceptions. For instance:
Biased:

The researcher’s groundbreaking findings have
revolutionized the field.

Objective:

The scholar’s research findings have significantly
contributed to advancing the discipline.

RESEARCH WRITING

7

Explanation
In the biased example, the phrase “groundbreaking findings” contains
subjective language that elevates the researcher’s work to an
exaggerated level. This expression implies a personal opinion rather
than an objective assessment of the research. Additionally, the term
“revolutionized” suggests a dramatic transformation, which may not
accurately reflect the actual impact of the findings. On the other hand,
the objective example maintains neutrality by using more restrained
language. The phrase “research findings” is neutral and factual,
focusing on the outcome of the study without embellishment. Instead
of overstating the significance of the findings, the objective language
acknowledges their contribution to the discipline in a measured and
unbiased manner. This approach enhances the credibility of the writer
and fosters a more balanced and impartial tone in academic writing.

1.3 Clarity of Expression
Clarity is essential in academic writing to ensure that readers
understand the content easily. This includes using clear, concise language
and organizing ideas logically. To enhance clarity, it is crucial to avoid
ambiguity and unnecessary complexity in your writing. Here is an example:
Unclear:

The results of the study were somewhat inconclusive.

Clear:

The findings did not provide definitive conclusions.

Explanation
In the unclear example, the phrase “somewhat inconclusive” introduces
ambiguity, leaving readers uncertain about the study’s outcomes. This
lack of clarity hampers comprehension and may lead to misinterpretation
of the findings. Additionally, the use of the qualifier “somewhat”
weakens the statement, further obscuring the message. Conversely, the
clear expression provides readers with a precise assessment of the
study’s findings. When stating that the findings “did not provide
definitive conclusions,” the writer communicates the uncertainty
inherent in the results. This straightforward and direct language
eliminates ambiguity. Clarity of expression promotes transparency and
understanding in academic writing, fostering effective communication
of research findings.

8

RESEARCH WRITING

1.4 Precise and Speciﬁc Language
In language studies, precision in language is crucial for accurately
conveying ideas. Employing precise and specific language enhances
communication effectiveness while minimizing ambiguity. For instance:
Vague:

The participants showed some improvement in
language skills.

Precise:

The participants demonstrated a significant
enhancement in their speaking proficiency.

Explanation
In the vague example, the phrase “some improvement” lacks specificity,
leaving readers uncertain about the extent or nature of the progress
observed. This ambiguity hinders comprehension and diminishes the
impact of the statement. Conversely, the precise language in the second
example clearly articulates the participants’ achievement by specifying
the aspect of language skills (speaking proficiency) and emphasizing the
significance of the enhancement observed. This precision enhances the
clarity and credibility of the statement, enabling readers to grasp the
exact nature of the participants’ progress without ambiguity. By using
precise and specific language, researchers in language studies can
effectively communicate their findings and insights with clarity and
accuracy.

1.5 Citing Sources
Academic writing requires proper attribution of sources to
acknowledge the ideas and research of others. Use citations and references
according to the appropriate citation style (such as APA) to acknowledge
the original authors and prevent plagiarism. Here is an example of citing a
source:
According to Smith (2019), “language acquisition is a
complex process influenced by various factors” (p. 25).

RESEARCH WRITING

9

Explanation
In this example, the author (Smith) is acknowledged for their contribution
to the understanding of language acquisition. A citation should contain
the author’s last name , the publication year , and the exact page
number where the information was sourced and directly quoted. This
enables readers to access the original source and verify the information
presented. By adhering to proper citation practices, writers demonstrate
academic integrity and uphold ethical standards in their research
endeavours.

Activity 1.1: Language Style and Convention
Directions : Read the provided sentences. Then rewrite the informal

sentences to adhere to formal language style and conventions and indicate
why it is informal.
Example:

Sentence:

The professor’s lectures are super cool.

Rewrite:

The professor’s presentations are exceptionally insightful.

Reason:

The word “super” is informal, and “cool” is a casual term.
"exceptionally impressive" is a more formal and specific
expression.

Sentences to Rewrite:

1. The book was really awesome.
________________________________________________________
2. This class is totally boring.
________________________________________________________
3. That experiment was kinda neat.

2. Grammatical Features in Research Writing
In research writing, adherence to grammatical rules is crucial for
conveying ideas accurately and effectively (Hinkel, 2013). This section will
explore key grammatical features essential in academic writing. By
understanding and applying these grammatical principles, you will be
better equipped to articulate their research findings clearly and
professionally.
Since there are a number of grammatical features, this section will
particularly focus key grammatical aspects essential in language studies
research writing (see Fig. 1.2), including subject-verb agreement, tense
consistency, and sentence structure (Romano, 2019).

RESEARCH WRITING

11

2.1 Subject-Verb Agreement
Subject-verb agreement is a key grammatical rule that ensures the
verb aligns in number with its subject within a sentence. In English, verbs
must agree with their subjects in number, whether singular or plural. Here
are some examples:
Incorrect:

The data is inconclusive.

Correct:

The data are inconclusive.

Explanation
In the incorrect example, the singular verb “is” does not agree with the
plural subject “data.” While “data” is often treated as a singular noun in
colloquial usage, it is technically a plural noun, referring to multiple
pieces of information. Therefore, to maintain subject-verb agreement,
the plural form of the verb, “are,” should be used instead of the singular
“is.” By correcting the sentence to “The data are inconclusive,” we
ensure that the verb “are” matches the plural subject “data,” resulting
in grammatical concordance. This adherence to subject-verb agreement
enhances the clarity and correctness of the sentence, allowing readers
to better understand the intended meaning without encountering
grammatical errors.

2.2 Tense Consistency
Tense consistency is essential in academic writing as it maintains
coherence and clarity by ensuring that verb tenses remain consistent
throughout a piece of writing. The tense selected should reflect both the
context and the nature of the research being described. Here is an example:
Inconsistent:

The researcher examined language acquisition
theories and concludes that...

Consistent:

The researcher examined language acquisition
theories and concluded that...

12

RESEARCH WRITING

Explanation
In the inconsistent example, the past tense verb “examined” is followed
by the present tense verb “concludes,” resulting in a lack of tense
consistency. This inconsistency can disrupt the flow of the sentence and
confuse the reader about the timing of the actions described. By
mai nt ai ni ng t ense consi st ency t hroughout t he sent ence, as
demonstrated in the corrected example, the past tense verb
“examined” is followed by the past tense verb “concluded.” This
consistent use of the past tense provides clarity about the timing of the
actions and ensures coherence in the narrative. Consistent tense usage
enhances the readability and comprehensibility of academic writing,
allowing readers to follow the sequence of events and understand the
researcher’s findings more effectively.

2.3 Sentence Structure
Sentence structure involves organizing words, phrases, and clauses
to create sentences that are coherent and grammatically correct. Varying
sentence structures adds richness and clarity to writing, enhancing its
overall quality. Here is an example:
Simple:

The students completed the language proficiency test.

Complex: After completing the language proficiency test, the

students analysed their performance and identified
areas for improvement.

Explanation
In the simple sentence, “The students completed the language
proficiency test,” the subject (“the students”) and the verb
(“completed”) form a basic sentence structure. While simple sentences
are concise and straightforward, they may lack complexity and depth.
In contrast, the complex sentence introduces additional elements, such
as a dependent clause (“After completing the language proficiency
test”) and a compound predicate (“analysed their performance and
identified areas for improvement”). These additional components
enrich the sentence structure, providing more detail and context to the
narrative. Furthermore, employing complex sentences facilitates the
expression of more detailed ideas and the relationships between
various elements, thereby enhancing the overall clarity and coherence
of the text.

RESEARCH WRITING

13

Understanding and applying grammatical features such as subjectverb agreement, tense consistency, and sentence structure are essential

for producing clear and coherent research writing in language studies. By
mastering these elements, researchers can communicate their ideas and
findings more effectively to their audience, thereby increasing the quality
and impact of their academic work. Practice incorporating these
grammatical features into your writing to improve your skills and elevate
the clarity and professionalism of your research writing in language studies.

Activity 1.2: Grammar Check
Directions : Read each sentence carefully. Then rewrite the corrected

sentence in the space provided.
Example:

Sentence:

3. Lexical Features in Research Writing
Lexical features play a crucial role in
research writing, which can influence the clarity,
precision, and professionalism of the text
(Vögelin et al., 2019). This section explores key
lexical elements commonly found in research
writing within the field of language studies (see
Fig. 1.3), including formal academic vocabulary,
discipline-specific terminology, and hedging
expressions. By mastering these lexical features,

3.1 Formal Academic Vocabulary
Formal academic vocabulary comprises words and phrases
specifically chosen for their precision and authority, essential for maintaining
professionalism and credibility in scholarly discourse. In language studies,
using formal academic terminology reflects a thorough understanding of
the topic and enhances the scholarly quality of the writing. Here are some
examples:
Informal:
Formal:

The teacher’s methods are cool.
The instructor’s pedagogical strategies are innovative.

Explanation
In the informal sentence, the term “cool” is colloquial and lacks the
precision expected in academic writing. By contrast, the formal
sentence employs the term “pedagogical strategies,” which refers to
the systematic approaches used in teaching and learning. This term is
more specific and carries a higher level of academic authority, suitable
for scholarly discourse in the field of language studies. Furthermore,
the word “innovative” in the formal sentence conveys a sense of
creativity and originality, emphasizing the forward-thinking nature of
the instructor’s strategies. Such precise language enhances the
credibility of the statement and demonstrates a sophisticated
understanding of pedagogy within the academic context. By utilizing
formal academic vocabulary like “pedagogical strategies” and
“innovative,” writers in language studies can elevate the quality of
their writing, establishing themselves as knowledgeable and
authoritative contributors to the field. This adherence to formal
v o c a b u l a r y c o n v e n t i o n s e n h a n c e s c l a r i t y, p r e c i s i o n , a n d
professionalism in academic discourse, ultimately strengthening the
impact of the research.

3.2 Discipline-Speciﬁc Terminology
Discipline-specific terminology refers to specialized terms and
concepts unique to a particular field of study, such as language studies.
Incorporating discipline-specific terminology in research writing
demonstrates expertise and familiarity with the subject matter (Nesi, 2012).
Here is an example:

16

RESEARCH WRITING

General:

The students learned a new language.

Discipline-specific:

The students acquired proficiency in a
second language.

Explanation
In the general sentence, the phrase “learned a new language” is
broad and lacks specificity regarding the level of proficiency attained
by the students. However, in the discipline-specific sentence, the
term “acquired proficiency” is used, which is specific to language
studies and indicates a deeper level of understanding and mastery of
the language. The term “acquired proficiency” suggests that the
students have not only learned the basics of the language but have
also developed a level of competence that enables effective
communication and comprehension. By using discipline-specific
terminology, the writer conveys a nuanced understanding of the
lear ning process within the discipline of language studies.
Furthermore, the phrase “second language” in the discipline-specific
sentence indicates the context in which the proficiency was acquired,
providing additional clarity and specificity to the statement. This
specificity is essential in academic writing as it helps readers
understand the precise nature of the research findings or assertions.
Incorporating discipline-specific terminology like “acquired
proficiency” and “second language” enhances the credibility and
precision of research writing in language studies. It demonstrates the
writer’s expertise in the field and contributes to the overall clarity and
professionalism of the text.

3.3 Hedging Expressions
Hedging expressions are linguistic tools utilized to temper the
certainty of statements, acknowledging the presence of uncertainty or
caution in the writer’s assertions (Bailey, 2018). In research writing, hedging
expressions play a crucial role in conveying academic humility and
recognizing the inherent limitations of the study. Here is an example:
Unhedged:

The results conclusively demonstrate...

Hedged:

The results tentatively suggest...

RESEARCH WRITING

17

Explanation
In the unhedged statement, the phrase “conclusively demonstrate”
implies a high level of certainty and confidence in the research
findings. However, in academic writing, the writer should acknowledge
the potential for alternative interpretations or limitations in the data.
By contrast, the hedged statement uses the term “tentatively
suggest,” which introduces a degree of caution and uncertainty into
the assertion. The use of the hedging expression “tentatively” signals
to the reader that the results are not definitive and may require further
investigation or validation. This expression of academic humility
aligns with the conventions of scholarly discourse, emphasizing the
importance of critical thinking and open-mindedness in research
writing. Hedging expressions allow writers to strike a balance
between confidence in their assertions and recognition of the inherent
uncertainties in research. By incorporating hedging expressions like
“tentatively suggest,” writers demonstrate intellectual integrity and
transparency, enhancing the credibility and reliability of their research
findings. Additionally, hedging expressions encourage readers to
engage critically with the research and consider alternative
interpretations, fostering a deeper understanding of the subject
matter.

In research writing in the field of language studies, mastering lexical
features such as for mal academic vocabulary , discipline-specific
terminology , and hedging expressions is essential for conveying ideas

with precision, clarity, and credibility. By carefully choosing the appropriate
words and phrases, writers can improve the professionalism and
effectiveness of their research writing, thereby advancing knowledge within
their field. Practice incorporating these lexical features into your writing to
elevate its quality and impact.

18

RESEARCH WRITING

4. Plagiarism
Plagiarism , which involves using or

copying someone else’s work without
p ro p e r a t t r i b u t i o n or c i t a t i o n s , is

regarded as a major ethical violation in
academic writing (Bielska & Rutkowski,
2022). In the field of language studies,
maintaining academic integrity is
necessary, as it ensures the credibility
and validity of research findings. You
will develop skills in paraphrasing,
summarizing, and accurately citing
sources to ensure that original authors receive proper credit and to preserve
the integrity of your own work.

4.1 Understanding Plagiarism
Plagiarism, in its various forms, constitutes a serious breach of
academic integrity, undermining the credibility and ethics of research
writing (Fatemi & Saito, 2020). The writer must grasp the different
manifestations of plagiarism to avoid inadvertently committing this offense.
The following are four key forms of plagiarism, namely direct copying,
inadequate paraphrasing, failure to cite sources, and submitting another’s
work.

4.1.1 Direct copying
Direct copying, a blatant form of plagiarism, occurs when an author
reproduces text verbatim from a source without appropriate
acknowledgment. This act not only violates academic integrity but also
undermines the credibility of the writer’s work.
Original Text (Smith, 2018):

Language acquisition is a multifaceted
process influenced by various
environmental and cognitive factors.

RESEARCH WRITING

Plagiarized Version:

19

Language acquisition is a multifaceted
process influenced by various
environmental and cognitive factors.

Explanation
In this example, the plagiarized version mirrors the original text word
for word without any indication of quotation or proper citation. The
absence of quotation marks and failure to attribute the statement to its
original source constitute a clear case of direct copying. Such conduct
disregards the intellectual property of the original author, depriving
them of due credit for their insights and violating ethical standards in
academic writing. Direct copying not only compromises the integrity of
the researcher but also undermines the trust and reliability of scholarly
discourse. To avoid this form of plagiarism, writers must always use
quotation marks to delineate borrowed text and provide accurate
citations to acknowledge the sources of their information. By adhering
to these guidelines, researchers support the academic honesty and
contribute to the advancement of knowledge with integrity.

4.1.2 Inadequate paraphrasing
Inadequate paraphrasing occurs when a writer attempts to rephrase
someone else’s ideas but fails to sufficiently alter the wording or structure,
resulting in content that closely resembles the original text. This form of
plagiarism misleads readers by presenting borrowed content as original
work, without proper acknowledgment of the original source.
Original Text (Jones, 2017): Bilingualism offers cognitive benefits

such as enhanced problem-solving skills
and greater cognitive flexibility.
Plagiarized Version:

Bilingualism provides cognitive
advantages such as improved problemsolving abilities and increased cognitive
adaptability.

20

RESEARCH WRITING

Explanation
In this example, although some words have been rearranged and
synonyms have been substituted, the core message and structure of the
original text remain largely intact . The plagiarized version fails to
adequately transform the content into the writer’s own words, thus
falling short of proper paraphrasing. Without proper attribution to the
original author, readers may be misled into believing that the ideas
presented are original to the writer. To avoid inadequate paraphrasing
and uphold academic integrity, writers must strive to rephrase borrowed
content in their own words while retaining the original meaning.
Additionally, proper citation is essential to acknowledge the source of
the ideas being paraphrased, ensuring transparency and honesty in
scholarly writing.

4.1.3 Failure to cite sources
Failing to cite sources for data, statistics, images, or any other form
of information used in the research constitutes plagiarism. Even if the
information is not directly quoted, proper attribution is necessary to
acknowledge the original source and provide readers with the opportunity
to verify the information independently.
A graph depicting language proficiency trends in bilingual children is
included in the research paper without citing the source from which the
data was obtained. [No citations of sources]

Explanation
In this scenario, it is likely that the researcher has incorporated a graph
into their paper to illustrate language proficiency trends in bilingual
children. However, they have failed to provide any citation or
acknowledgment of the source from which the data for the graph was
obtained. This omission deprives readers of the opportunity to assess
the reliability and credibility of the data presented. By neglecting to
cite the source, the researcher not only violates academic norms but
also undermines the transparency and trustworthiness of their research
findings. To avoid the pitfall of failing to cite sources, researchers must
diligently document the origins of all external information included in
their work. Whether it’s data, statistics, images, or any other content,
proper citation ensures accountability and upholds the principles of
intellectual honesty. By accurately attributing sources, researchers
contribute to the integrity of academic discourse and demonstrate
respect for the contributions of others in their field.

RESEARCH WRITING

21

4.1.4 Submitting another’s work
Submitting someone else’s work, whether in whole or in part, as
your own is a severe form of plagiarism. This includes purchasing or
downloading essays, papers, or assignments from online sources and
presenting them as original work. Submitting work produced by another
individual violates academic honesty and can lead to severe consequences,
including academic sanctions.
A student submits an essay obtained from a commercial essaywriting service under their own name, passing it off as their original
work.

Explanation
In this instance, the student has procured an essay from a commercial
essay-writing service and submitted it as their own creation. By doing
so, they deceive their academic institution and instructors, presenting
the purchased essay as their original intellectual output. This behaviour
not only undermines the principles of academic honesty but also
compromises the educational integrity of the institution. Submitting
work produced by another individual deprives the student of the
opportunity to engage with the subject matter, develop essential skills,
and demonstrate their own understanding and proficiency.
Consequences for such misconduct can be severe, ranging from failing
grades on assignments to academic probation or even expulsion from
the institution. To uphold academic integrity and maintain trust within
the academic community, it is imperative for students to produce their
own work and attribute credit to external sources appropriately. By
engaging in honest scholarship and ethical conduct, students uphold
the values of academic excellence and contribute to the integrity of
their educational institution.

Understanding the various forms of plagiarism is crucial for
upholding academic integrity and ensuring the ethical conduct of research
writing. When researchers recognize and refrain from these practices, they
honor intellectual property rights and advance knowledge with honesty and
integrity.

22

RESEARCH WRITING

4.2 Strategies to Avoid Plagiarism
4.2.1 Paraphrasing
Paraphrasing means expressing someone else’s ideas using your
own words while preserving their original meaning. It is crucial to properly
cite the source when paraphrasing to avoid plagiarism. Here is an example:
Original Text: Chomsky’s universal grammar theory proposes that

humans are inherently equipped with the innate
ability to acquire language.
Paraphrased: According to Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar,

every individual possesses an inherent capacity to
acquire language from birth.

Explanation
In the original text, Chomsky’s theory of universal grammar is presented,
asserting that humans have an innate ability to learn language from birth.
To paraphrase this idea, the writer has reworded the statement while
preserving its essential meaning. Instead of using the exact words of the
original text, the writer has employed different language and sentence
structure to convey the same concept. The paraphrased version maintains
fidelity to the original idea by referencing Chomsky’s theory of universal
grammar and emphasizing the inherent capacity of every individual to
acquire language from birth. By paraphrasing in this manner, the writer
avoids directly copying the original text while still acknowledging the
source of the idea. This approach ensures academic integrity and
demonstrates the writer’s understanding of the concept while presenting
it in their own words.

4.2.2 Summarising
Summarising entails condensing the main points of a source into
your own words. Like paraphrasing, summarising requires proper citation to
avoid plagiarism. Here is an example:
Original Text: Researchers conducted a longitudinal study to

investigate the impact of bilingualism on cognitive
development in children.

RESEARCH WRITING

Summary:

23

A longitudinal study was carried out to examine the
effects of bilingualism on the cognitive development
of children.

Explanation
In the original text, researchers describe conducting a longitudinal study
to examine the effects of bilingualism on children’s cognitive
development. To summarize this information, the writer has compressed
the main idea while maintaining its essential meaning. The summary
conveys the key components of the original text—mentioning the type
of study (longitudinal), the researchers involved, and the focus of the
research (impact of bilingualism on cognitive development in children).
By summarizing in this way, the writer effectively encapsulates the
central theme of the original text without directly copying its wording.
This approach ensures that the writer acknowledges the source while
presenting the information in a succinct and digestible manner, thereby
avoiding plagiarism.

4.2.3 Citing sources
Whenever you use someone else’s ideas, words, or findings in your
research, you should provide appropriate citations. This includes both intext citations and a comprehensive list of references at the end of your
paper. Failure to cite sources can constitute plagiarism. Here is an example
of an in-text citation:
Original Text:

Krashen’s input hypothesis posits that language
learners achieve the best language acquisition
outcomes when they are provided with language
input that they can understand.

In-text Citation: According to Krashen (1985), language learners

benefit from exposure to comprehensible input.

24

RESEARCH WRITING

Explanation
In the original text, Krashen’s input hypothesis is introduced, stating that
language learners learn best when they receive understandable input.
To avoid plagiarism and give credit to the original author, Krashen, the
writer includes an in-text citation. The in-text citation format adheres to
academic conventions, providing the reader with the necessary
information to locate the source in the reference list. It includes the
author’s last name (Krashen) and the year of publication (1985) within
parentheses. This format allows readers to identify the specific source
from which the information is derived. By including the citation, the
writer acknowledges Krashen’s contribution to the idea presented in the
text, thereby maintaining academic integrity and avoiding plagiarism.

4.3 Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is the cornerstone of ethical research practices,
ensuring honesty and transparency in scholarly endeavors (Çelik & Razı,
2023; Tijdink et al., 2021). Upholding academic integrity entails adhering to
ethical standards and principles throughout the research process. This
involves properly citing sources to recognize the original authors and
acknowledging the intellectual contributions of others.
By citing sources accurately and ethically, researchers demonstrate
their commitment to academic integrity and contribute to the credibility
and reliability of their work. Proper citation not only respects the intellectual
property rights of others but also fosters a culture of trust and accountability
within the academic community.
For example, when a researcher uses ideas, data, or findings from
previous studies that are not widely known or accepted, they must clearly
attribute these to the original sources. This ensures that readers can verify
the information presented and trace its origins back to the original authors.
By citing sources accurately, researchers uphold the principles of academic

Introduction to a Research Proposal
“Writing a research proposal is like making a case to your parents for a puppy:
you need to prove it's worth it, show you're ready for the responsibility,
and convince them it’s not just a passing phase!”

Imagine embarking on a jour ney without a map or a clear
destination. This is what conducting research without a well-structured
proposal feels like. A research proposal is more than just a formal
document. A research proposal is a comprehensive plan that defines the
objectives, methods, and importance of a research project. It acts as a
roadmap/blueprint for the research process, which guides the researcher
through each phase of the study and providing a structure for assessing the
project's practicality and academic significance.
A well-crafted research proposal is essential not only for gaining
approval from academic committees (particularly in higher education) or
securing funding but also for clearly articulating the researcher’s intentions
and expected contributions to the field. Understanding how to write an
effective research proposal is crucial because it helps ensure that the
research is well-conceived and systematically planned, thereby increasing
the likelihood of meaningful outcomes.
The process begins with identifying a clear research problem ,
which is the foundation of any proposal. This is followed by defining the
research purpose , which articulates the study’s aims and significance.
Recognizing existing gaps in the literature allows the researcher to

position their study within the broader academic conversation. From there,
formulating specific research questions provides a focused direction for

the investigation. Finally, understanding the key components of a research
proposal ensures that all necessary elements are included to communicate
the plan effectively. In the sections that follow, we will explore each of these
critical steps in detail, providing a comprehensive guide to writing a
successful research proposal.

32

RESEARCH WRITING

Identifying a Research Problem
The research problem is a vital element of a research proposal, as it
directs the study. This section illustrates the process of identifying,
developing, and clearly expressing a problem statement.
A well-defined problem statement precisely outlines the issue and
assists in identifying the variables to be examined. Miles and Scott (2017)
assert that a problem statement should (1) explain the justification for the
study and (2) utilize data and existing literature to support the necessity of
addressing the problem. Key characteristics of an effective problem
statement (Creswell, 2021; Rudestam & Newton, 2014) include:
1. Clarity and precision
2. The identification of what will be studied
3. The identification of an overarching question and key variables
4. The articulation of the study’s boundaries
5. A conveyance of the study’s importance
6. No use of unnecessary jargons
7. Being timely
8. The identification of deficiencies in the literature about the problem
Several scholars (e.g., Adu & Miles, 2024) have identified challenges
in developing a problem statement. These challenges often arise from not
addressing two essential questions: (1) Why is this topic important to study?
and (2) What is the purpose of this investigation? Below are common pitfalls
to avoid:
1. Lack of Compelling Reason: Many researchers fail to provide

a convincing rationale for why their study is necessary.
2. Lack of Persuasion: Some studies do not effectively identify

or emphasize the significance of the problem, making it
unconvincing.
3. Lack of Clarity: The problem should be explicitly stated;

ambiguity can undermine the entire research study.
4. Poor Topic Choice: It is essential to select a problem with a

solid foundation for investigation.

RESEARCH WRITING

33

5. Problem Nexus: Researchers often fail to establish a clear

connection between the problem and the rationale for the
study.
6. Unclear Problem Statement: While the purpose statement is

usually clear, the problem statement is often not well-defined.
To prevent these issues, you can utilize a tool known as the
“Statement Grid ” (Miles & Scott, 2017, p. 15). This tool assists in visually
representing your problem and crafting a clear problem statement. It
outlines three potential subproblems that serve as the foundation for your
research, adhering to the principle of “the rule of three –three plausible
reasons to support your argument and position with three points” (Adu &
Miles, 2024, p. 125).

From Table 2.2, you can establish a solid foundation for your
problem statement. Begin with a comprehensive problem statement and
then break it down into two or three compelling subparts.

Deﬁning a Research Purpose
Generally, the research purpose statement comes after the problem
statement. It acts as a link between identifying the problem and formulating
the research questions. Often, researchers do not effectively connect these
parts, which can lead to inconsistencies in the study. The purpose statement
strengthens the problem statement by clearly outlining the study’s goals.
A purpose statement is a clear declaration of the study’s objective.
It should answer two main questions: 1) What is the main goal? and 2) What
are the specific goals of the study? Essentially, the research purpose
explains why the study is being conducted. It typically identifies the
variables, the population, and the setting of the study. According to Long
et al. (1985), the purpose statement (1) provides the reasoning behind the
study and (2) uses existing research to justify the need for the study. Firstly,
the purpose statement explains the reasoning for the study by highlighting
its importance and necessity. Secondly, it relies on previous literature to
support and confirm the need to address the stated purpose, ensuring that
the study is based on established academic work.
Table 2.3 below lists powerful verbs for purpose statements,
highlighting their proactive nature. However, the verb understand is not
recommended as it is considered weak for a purpose statement (Adu &
Miles, 2024).

When creating the purpose statement, it is recommended to use
the Statement Grid. First, the researcher should draft the overall purpose
statement. Then, break the purpose down into two or three specific
objectives that align with the issues identified in the problem statement

RESEARCH WRITING

Step-by-Step Procedures
Step 1:
Conduct a Comprehensive Literature Review

Begin by conducting a thorough literature review in
the field of language studies (see Chapter 3). Utilize
academic databases, scholarly journals, books, and
other relevant resources to collect research related to
your topic. Focus on both recent studies and key works
in the field to ensure your literature review is current
and comprehensive.
Step 2:
Analyze Existing Literature

Once you have gathered a substantial amount of
literature, critically analyze the existing studies to
identify gaps, inconsistencies, or areas needing further
exploration. Look for patterns, contradictions, or
unanswered questions that emerge across different
studies. Consider the theoretical frameworks,
methodologies, findings, and limitations of previous
research to gain insights into areas where additional
research is warranted. In this step, you may consider
using the literature review matrix (see Table 2.6) to
help you indicate some gaps in previous studies.
Step 3:
Identify Common Themes and Trends

Identify common themes, trends, or emerging issues
in the literature that suggest areas of research gaps.
Pay attention to recurring topics, debates, or
controversies that indicate unresolved questions or
a re a s n e e d i n g c l a r i f i c a t i o n . L o o k f o r g a p s i n

RESEARCH WRITING

knowledge, contradictory findings, or underexplored
topics that present opportunities for new research
directions.
Step 4:
Consider Practical Implications and Real-World Relevance

Consider the practical implications and real-world
relevance of existing research in language studies.
Evaluate whether previous studies address pressing
issues, practical challenges, or emerging trends in
language learning, teaching, bilingualism,
sociolinguistics, or other subfields. Identify gaps
between academic research and practical applications
in language education, policy-making, or languagerelated interventions.
Step 5:
Consult with Experts and Peers

Engage in discussions with experts, mentors, peers, or
colleagues in the field of language studies to gain
diverse perspectives and insights. Seek feedback on
your literature review and research ideas to identify
blind spots, overlooked areas, or novel research
opportunities. Collaborate with others to brainstorm
potential research questions and explore innovative
approaches to addressing research gaps.
Step 6:
Formulate Research Questions

Based on your review of the literature and identified
research gaps, develop clear and focused research
questions that target specific language-related issues.
Make sure your questions are relevant, practical, and

40

RESEARCH WRITING

aim to advance knowledge in language studies. Align
these questions with the gaps you have identified and
consider how your research can address them,
contributing meaningfully to the field.

In summary, identifying research gaps in language studies involves
a systematic approach, which includes conducting a thorough literature
review, critically evaluating current research, recognizing key themes and
trends, considering practical applications, consulting with experts, and
developing relevant research questions.

RESEARCH WRITING

Types of Research Gaps
One of the main goals of conducting research is to fill a research
gap. However, there are many types of research gaps that the readers can
consider adopting. Miles (2017) proposed a new model built on the
previous models (e.g., Robinson et al., 2011) that consist of seven core
research gaps renamed:

1. Evidence Gap
An evidence gap occurs when a new research finding challenges
widely accepted conclusions. This gap arises from contradictions in
previous research findings. To identify such contradictory evidence, it is
necessary to first analyze each research stream and then synthesize the
results to uncover the inconsistencies (Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014).
Most research suggests that using games in the classroom improves vocabulary
retention for English language learners. However, a recent study finds no
significant improvement in students’ vocabulary scores when games are
used. This contradictory finding creates an evidence gap, suggesting that

further research is needed to understand under what conditions games might
or might not be effective.

Example

2. Knowledge Gap
A knowledge gap can occur under two conditions when the desired
research findings are unavailable (Jacobs, 2011; Müller-Bloch & Kranz,
2014; Miles, 2017).
Ø First, relevant knowledge may be lacking within the specific
field, requiring the use of theories and literature from related
domains.
Ø Second, the results of a study may differ from the expected
outcomes (Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014)
While there is extensive research on how adults learn English as a second
language, there is little information on how non-native English-speaking
children aged 8–10 acquire idiomatic expressions. This absence of specific

knowledge represents a gap that could be filled by conducting studies focused
on younger learners’ understanding and usage of idioms.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

43

3. Practical-Knowledge Conﬂict Gap
A practical-knowledge (or action-knowledge) conflict emerges when
professionals, such as teachers, behave differently from the behavior they
are encouraged to adopt.
Many language teaching theories advocate for the exclusive use of the target
language (English) in the classroom. However, in practice, some teachers
frequently switch to the students’ native language to explain complex
grammar rules. This discrepancy between theory and practice highlights a gap

where further research could explore the reasons behind teachers’ choices and
the impact on students' learning.

Example

4. Methodological Gap
This methodological gap addresses discrepancies in research
methods used in prior studies and introduces an alternative line of inquiry
by employing different approaches. It is important to consider varying
research methods, particularly when certain topics have been predominantly
investigated using a single or common method (Müller-Bloch & Kranz,
2014).
Most studies on the effectiveness of feedback in English writing have used
quantitative surveys to gather data. However, there is a lack of qualitative
research exploring students’ personal experiences and perceptions of
different feedback types. Conducting interviews or focus groups could

provide a new perspective on how students feel about feedback and how it
affects their writing skills.

Example

5. Empirical Gap
An empirical gap arises when prior research has not yet provided
sufficient evidence or verification for certain findings or propositions. This
gap involves the need to evaluate or empirically test research claims. For
instance, an empirical gap often highlights that no study has directly
examined a subject or topic using an empirical approach.

44

RESEARCH WRITING

There is a theoretical belief that multimedia tools (like videos and interactive
apps) enhance listening skills in English learners. However, no empirical
studies have directly tested this assumption in a controlled classroom
setting. Conducting an experiment to measure listening comprehension

improvements when using multimedia tools could fill this empirical gap.

Example

6. Theoretical Gap
A theoretical gap refers to the lack of comprehensive theory in
previous research. These gaps are common when reviewing prior studies
on a particular phenomenon, where the existing theoretical frameworks
may be incomplete or insufficient (Müller-Bloch & Kranz, 2014).
Theories on SLA often emphasize the importance of social interaction for
learning English. However, these theories do not adequately address how
introverted learners might benefit differently from social interaction
compared to extroverted learners. Research exploring this nuance could fill a

theoretical gap by expanding existing theories to account for personality
differences.

Example

7. Population Gap
A population gap is frequently acknowledged by researchers and
occurs when certain groups or populations are underrepresented or have
not been adequately studied in existing research.
Much of the research on English language learning strategies focuses on
students in urban areas. However, there is a lack of studies on rural learners,
who may face different challenges and have different needs. Addressing this

population gap could involve investigating the specific barriers and strategies
used by rural English learners.

Formulating Research Questions

Designed by FreePik

Formulating research questions is a critical step in the research
process as it shapes the direction and focus of your study. In the field of
language studies, where the scope is vast and diverse, crafting precise and
relevant research questions is essential for conducting meaningful research.
This chapter will guide you through the process of formulating research
questions in language studies by drawing insights from existing literature
and exploring various approaches to developing research inquiries.

1. How to Formulate Research Questions
1.1 Understanding the Importance of Research Questions
Research questions serve as the foundation of any study, guiding
researchers in their exploration of a particular topic or issue. In language
studies, research questions help to narrow down the focus of inquiry,
identify specific areas of interest, and provide a framework for data
collection and analysis. By formulating clear and concise research questions,
researchers can articulate the purpose of their study and communicate the
intended outcomes to their audience.

RESEARCH WRITING

49

1.2 Drawing Insights from Existing Literature
Before formulating research questions, the researcher should
conduct a thorough review of existing literature in the field of language
studies. By reviewing relevant studies, researchers can identify gaps,
controversies, or areas needing further investigation. Analyzing existing
literature can also help researchers refine their research questions by
ensuring that they build upon previous research and contribute new insights
to the field.

1.3 Identifying Key Variables and Concepts
Research questions in language studies often revolve around key
variables and concepts related to language acquisition, language teaching,
bilingualism, sociolinguistics, and other subfields. To formulate effective
research questions, researchers must clearly define these variables and
concepts and understand their interrelationships. By identifying key
variables and concepts, researchers can develop research questions that
address specific aspects of language-related phenomena and contribute to
theoretical or practical knowledge in the field.

1.4 Exploring Di^erent Types of Research Questions
In language studies, research questions can vary based on the
study’s nature and objectives. Common types include descriptive,
exploratory, explanatory, comparative, and evaluative questions. Each type
serves a unique purpose and demands a specific approach in its
formulation. By considering these different types, researchers can select the
format that best fits their study, ensuring that the research questions align
with their objectives.

50

RESEARCH WRITING

1.5 Crafting Clear and Speciﬁc Research Questions
Effective research questions in language studies are clear, specific,
and focused on a particular aspect of language-related phenomena. To
craft clear and specific research questions, researchers should avoid vague
or overly broad inquiries and instead, formulate questions that are precise
and actionable. Research questions should also be framed in a way that
allows for empirical investigation and data collection, ensuring that
researchers can gather relevant evidence to address their research
objectives.

RESEARCH WRITING

3. Common Mistakes to Be Avoided
Coming up with some research questions can be challenging and
straightforward at the same time, but there are some common mistakes or
pitfalls in writing research questions.

3.1 Lack of Speciﬁcity
Research questions that are too broad or vague fail to provide a
clear direction for the study. For example, this question “How do people
learn languages?” is too general and lacks specificity.

3.2 Overly Complex Questions
Research questions that are too complex or contain multiple subquestions can confuse the focus of the study. A question like “How do age,

gender, and socioeconomic status influence language learning and use
across different regions?” may try to cover too much at once.

3.3 Leading or Biased Questions
Research questions that suggest a particular answer or are phrased
in a way that leads respondents to a specific answer can bias the study
results. An example is, “Why is bilingual education better than monolingual
education?”

3.4 Unfeasibility
Questions that are not feasible to answer due to constraints in time,
resources, or data availability can hinder the research process. For instance,
“What are the effects of every language teaching method ever used in
schools?” is unrealistic due to its broad scope.

3.5 Ambiguous Terminology
Using ter ms that are N O T clearly defined can lead to
misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the research question. For
example, asking about “language skills” without specifying which skills can
lead to ambiguity.

Components of a Research Proposal
When preparing a research proposal, several essential components
must be included to clearly outline the intended study. These elements
ensure that the proposal is structured, informative, and meets academic
standards. The Introduction presents the research problem and objectives,
setting the foundation for the study. The Literature Review situates the
research within the context of existing studies, identifying the gaps that the
proposed work aims to address. The Methodology section outlines the
research design, including data collection and analysis methods,
showcasing the feasibility and rigor of the proposed approach. Lastly,
References provide a properly formatted list of all sources cited,

demonstrating scholarly rigor and adherence to academic conventions.
Each of these components plays a critical role in crafting a persuasive and
effective research proposal.

1. Introduction

2. Literature Review
The literature review serves as a critical foundation for any research
study, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the existing knowledge
related to the topic under investigation. This Literature Review chapter
systematically examines previous studies, theories, and key findings,
highlighting both the progress made in the field and the gaps that still
exist. By analyzing a range of scholarly works, the literature review not only
situates the current research within the broader academic discourse but
also demonstrates the necessity and relevance of the study. Moreover, it
helps to identify methodological approaches, theoretical frameworks, and
conceptual models that have shaped the understanding of the topic.
Through this process, the literature review clarifies how the present study

RESEARCH WRITING

57

contributes to ongoing conversations in the field, ensuring that it builds on,
challenges, or refines existing knowledge rather than replicating it.
Ultimately, this section is essential for justifying the research questions and
guiding the direction of the study, underscoring its potential impact on
both theory and practice.
There are two types of literature reviews: dedicated and recursive
literature reviews. A dedicated literature review is a separate chapter that
comes right after the introduction, titled “Literature Review.” In this type,
all the information about previous research and theories is kept in one or
more specific chapters. This type is more common in research writing, since
it helps readers easily find and understand the background information
related to your study, as it is all in one place.

A recursive literature review, on the other hand, spreads the review

of existing literature throughout the thesis. Instead of having a single
chapter for the literature review, this approach introduces relevant literature
in the introduction and continues to expand on it in various sections of the
thesis. Each part of your research has its own literature review, which is
closely connected to the specific study discussed in that section. This
method allows the literature review to provide context and detail for each
part of the research.

also engages with it critically. Chapter 3 will guide you in developing wellstructured arguments, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of various
studies, and identifying gaps in the current literature. Also, you will learn
how to create a literature review that provides a solid foundation for your
own research, demonstrating a deep understanding of the topic and
contributing to the academic conversation in your field.

3. Methodology
Imagine trying to build a house without a blueprint or set of tools—
just as impossible is conducting meaningful research without a clear
methodology. The methodology outlines every detail of your research
journey, ensuring that each step is purposeful and coherent.
When doing a research project, the methodology is your roadmap,
guiding every step from data collection to analysis. It is the backbone of

RESEARCH WRITING

any research proposal, determining how effectively you can answer your
research questions and achieve your objectives. A well-thought-out
methodology not only provides clarity and direction for the researcher but
also lends credibility and validity to the study’s findings. But what exactly is
research methodology, and why is it so crucial to the research process?
In the following sections, we will explore what constitutes a research
methodology, the key components involved, and why having a solid
methodological foundation is essential for producing meaningful and
reliable research outcomes.

The process of writing the Research Methodology section is
explained in Chapters 4 and 5. These chapters provide a detailed guide on
how to structure this section effectively, covering all the necessary
components such as research design, participant selection, data collection
methods, data analysis procedures, and ethical considerations. This guide
provides detailed instructions and examples to help you clearly explain the
research study's methodological framework. It also ensures that the
methods selected are consistent with the research objectives and questions.

4. References
All the cited sources must be acknowledged in the references
section, which will be discussed in Chapter 11.

Summary
This chapter has outlined the key elements required for writing a
strong research proposal. A research proposal serves as a detailed plan,
outlining the study’s objectives, methodology, and importance. It begins by
identifying a clear research problem, which forms the basis for defining the
research purpose and crafting focused research questions. The chapter also
emphasized the importance of recognizing gaps in existing literature to

the field.

Clearly, a literature review goes beyond merely summarizing various
sources related to your topic; it involves analyzing, synthesizing, and
providing a critical evaluation of the reviewed sources.

RESEARCH WRITING

67

To produce a high-quality literature review, the quality of the
sources is also crucial. In the following section, we will explore how to
ensure that the sources you use meet high standards of quality.

Ensuring the Quality of Sources

According to Blakeslee (2004), The CRAAP test is a helpful tool for
researchers to evaluate the credibility and rigor of literature or sources.
Applying these criteria, researchers can ensure that their sources are
trustworthy and relevant to their work. This test comprises five criteria:
1) Currency : Examines how up-to-date the information is and whether
newer information is available;
2) Relevance: Assesses whether the information is related to the research
topic;
3) Authority: Evaluates the credibility of the source's author or publisher;
4) Accuracy : Determines if the information is reliable, truthful, and
supported by evidence; and
5) Purpose : Investigates the reason behind the information's existence,
checking for bias or prejudice.
Another crucial point is the authority of the sources that the
researcher cites. Simply put, the researcher should ensure the credibility

68

RESEARCH WRITING

and trustworthiness of these sources, which will be discussed in the
following section.

Source Authority

When conducting a literature review, it is crucial to select sources that
are reliable and credible, prioritizing peer-reviewed journals (Soden & Gow,
2018). These sources are rigorously evaluated by field experts, ensuring high
scholarly standards and significant contributions to existing knowledge.
However, caution is needed with online sources due to the lack of
rigorous vetting, which can lead to unverified and misleading information.
While some web resources from established academic institutions, government
agencies, or reputable organizations may be valuable, it is important to
critically assess their credibility.

In language studies, it is important to prioritize certain databases
for research, such as Scopus, ERIC, and the Thai Citation Index (TCI).
Scopus, in particular, is highly regarded and is considered one of the top
databases in the field. Using these databases for literature reviews ensures
that the sources you analyze are both credible and reliable.

A literature review involves searching for and selecting relevant
literature to critically analyze and present the findings. This process
enhances your understanding of the topic or problem of interest. While
writing a literature review, some might provide general reasons such as
understanding what has been previously studied, identifying research gaps,
and demonstrating thorough research on the topic (Callahan, 2014).
However, a literature review covers more than these reasons. By reflecting
deeply and critically on the purpose of conducting a literature review, one
can identify four primary goals that need to be achieved (see Fig. 3.1).

RESEARCH WRITING

Adu and Miles (2024, p. 10) emphasize that the key purposes of
conducting a literature review are: 1) refining your ability to understand,
evaluate, and present academic research, 2) expanding your knowledge on
the topic, 3) developing arguments to support your study, and 4)
contributing to the existing body of knowledge.

1. Reﬁning your ability to understand, evaluate, and present
academic research
There are reasons for conducting a literature review. One key reason is
that it helps you refine your abilities to 'consume,' 'critique,' and 'communicate'
your research project. By reading and comprehending the literature, you can
critically assess its components and overall quality. To guide your critical
analysis, consider asking these questions:
§

What is the main purpose of reviewing the literature?

§

What aspects of the literature stand out as particularly interesting?

§

What claims are presented in the literature?

§

How well does the evidence back up these claims?

§

Are there any unexpected findings or information?

After completing the research, performing a literature review
enhances your ability to communicate studies effectively and in a way that
resonates with your audience. As a research communicator, it is essential to
thoroughly digest relevant literature , integrate it into a cohesive
narrative , and present your review in a manner that helps readers

understand your position within the existing body of research. This process
allows them to see how your work connects to previous studies and aligns
with your future research objectives (see Fig. 3.2).

RESEARCH WRITING

2. Expanding your knowledge on the topic
When starting a research project, the researchers should become
familiar with existing studies and scholarly debates relevant to your topic. This
is why reviewing the literature is a key first step in the research process. As you
carefully review the literature, you may spot patterns that suggest areas for
deeper exploration. Analyzing these patterns helps you place your study within
the appropriate context.
To achieve this, you should compare and contrast ideas and elements
across different sources. First, establish the common basis for your comparison
by asking what unites the literature you are reviewing: topic, methods,
population, procedure, or findings. Once you identify these commonalities,
examine the similarities and differences concerning a specific issue. For
example, you might explore studies that share the same topic and methodology
but yield different results. Using tools like a Venn diagram (see Fig. 3.3) can
assist in visually comparing and contrasting studies, making it easier to identify
their connections.

Figure 3.3 A Venn diagram for literature analysis

72

RESEARCH WRITING

3. Developing an argument(s) in supporting your study
A primary goal of a literature review is to establish a clear rationale for
your research. Readers will expect you to answer two key questions:
1) How does your study relate to the existing research? and 2) Why is your
study important in light of what has already been done in the field? To address
these, you must provide convincing arguments that justify the need for your
research and show how it fits within the current body of knowledge on the
topic.

Evidence

Assumptions

Claim

Conclusion

Arguments

Figure 3.4 The elements of an argument (Jaakkola, 2020)

When building an argument, it should consist of four key components:
a claim, supporting evidence, assumptions (whether explicit or implied), and a
conclusion (Jaakkola, 2020). In a literature review, the researchers are expected
to draw conclusions or make observations based on a careful and critical
analysis of prior research. For instance, you may note that few studies on your
topic employ qualitative methods. What evidence backs up this claim? Can we
assume that you conducted an exhaustive review of relevant studies before
making this statement? These questions guide the development of a wellfounded rationale for your research, ensuring it is both relevant and significant
in the broader academic context.

RESEARCH WRITING

73

Remember, in research, you need to present a claim , support it with
well-founded reasons and evidence , address counter-argument , and when

necessary, clarify your reasoning principles.

4. Contributing to existing knowledge
When conducting a literature review, you help readers stay updated on
the latest trends and developments in your field. By gathering, analyzing, and
synthesizing relevant studies, you contribute to the growing body of
knowledge. A literature review can be structured in different ways, such as
chronologically, thematically, conceptually, or methodologically.

4.1 Chronological presentation
If your literature review aims to explore how a theory or phenomenon
has been studied over time, organizing the literature in a chronological manner
can be very effective. This approach allows you to present a synthesis of the
literature on a topic as it has developed over different periods.

Research on language motivation has evolved from early theories to more
complex models. Gardner and Lambert (1959) first emphasized integrative
motivation, focusing on the desire to connect with the target language
community. In the 1980s, Deci and Ryan (1985) introduced Self-Determination
Theory, distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. By the 2000s,
Dörnyei (2005) developed the L2 Motivational Self System, linking motivation
to learners’ future identities. Recent studies, like Ushioda (2011), highlight the
dynamic nature of motivation, considering individual and social factors. This
evolution reflects a shift from static concepts to understanding motivation as a
multifaceted, context-dependent phenomenon.

Example

74

RESEARCH WRITING

4.2 Thematic presentation
With a thematic approach, you begin by identifying the key themes
you wish to explore, and then categorize the relevant literature under each
theme, providing a synthesized review that examines and discusses each theme
separately.

Research on language motivation in second language acquisition has explored
various themes over the years. Gardner and Lambert (1959) first differentiated
between integrative motivation , the desire to connect with the language
community, and instrumental motivation, focused on practical benefits. Later,
Deci and Ryan (1985) expanded on this by distinguishing between intrinsic
motivation , driven by personal satisfaction, and extrinsic motivation ,

influenced by external rewards. Building on these foundations, Dörnyei (2005)
introduced the L2 Motivational Self System , which ties motivation to the
learner’s vision of their future self. More recently, Ushioda (2011) emphasized
the dynamic and context-dependent nature of motivation , considering
individual and social influences. This evolving narrative shows a comprehensive
shift from static to more dynamic understandings of language motivation.
Example

4.3 Conceptual presentation
This method involves synthesizing the literature based on a specific
theory relevant to your study. A strategy for this approach is to present each
pertinent theory and discuss the studies related to it, examining how well it
explains the phenomenon under investigation.

A conceptual review of language motivation highlights several theories central
to understanding second language acquisition. Gardner’s Socio-Educational
Model emphasizes integrative motivation, where a desire to connect with the

language community drives learning (Gardner & Lambert, 1959). Deci and
Ryan's (1985) Self-Determination Theory distinguishes between intrinsic

motivation, which comes from personal enjoyment, and extrinsic motivation,
which is shaped by external rewards. Similarly, Dörnyei’s (2005) L2 Motivational
Self System connects motivation to a learner’s future self-image, proposing

that imagining oneself as a proficient language user enhances motivation.
Together, these theories offer a comprehensive view of the factors influencing
language learning motivation.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

75

4.4 Methodological presentation
In this type of review, you organize the literature based on the research
methods used in the studies. This approach is particularly useful when you
need to justify your choice of a particular research method. It involves
comparing findings and conclusions drawn from different methodologies.

Research on language motivation has adopted various methodologies to
explore different dimensions of the topic. Quantitatively, Gardner and Lambert
(1959) utilized surveys to identify broad patterns in motivation, like the role of
integrative motivation in language proficiency. On the other hand, qualitative
research , like Deci and Ryan (1985), employed interviews to understand

learners’ personal experiences and intrinsic motivations in depth. In addition,
mixed-method approaches , such as those by Dörnyei (2005), integrated

surveys and interviews to examine how motivational factors interact. These
methodological differences highlight the value of integrating quantitative and
qualitative approaches, as doing so offers a more complete understanding of
the complex nature of language motivation.

Example

Now, the next section will discuss how to construct arguments in
research writing.

Building Arguments
A literature review involves a systematic
search of scholarly works that are relevant to the

researcher’s interest or project. Importantly, this
section not only covers an overview, summary, or
description of previous studies but also develops
arguments based on the reviewed research and

theoretical discussions. This critical analysis helps

the researcher identify 1) what has been accomplished in prior studies, 2) what
gaps exist, or 3) innovative approaches to explore the topic further and
contribute to the ongoing academic conversation.
The value and quality of a literature review depend on several factors:
1) the researcher’s ability to locate a sufficient amount of relevant research,

76

RESEARCH WRITING

thoroughly read it, and integrate only the most pertinent studies into their
review, 2) their skill in guiding readers through the literature with a clear
perspective and argument, 3) the extent to which they evaluate rather than
merely describe the literature, and 4) their capacity to identify gaps, analyze
controversies, suggest future research questions, or justify their own study.

Thought-provoking Task

In pairs or groups, discuss what is meant by the writer’s argument. Consider
why it is different from an opinion, point of view or belief. Also, discuss why
argument, stance, or position is important in academic writing.

Text 1
Mickey Mouse has become a cherished symbol of America's success,
reflecting a time of prosperity and dominance for the nation. He represents the
United States' economic and political strength during its peak. Interestingly, a
creature often viewed as a pest in other countries found fame in America, rising
to stardom and becoming a household name. This transformation mirrors the
American dream, where even unlikely figures—whether human or not—can
experience freedom, self-expression, and the chance to succeed.
The theme of the underdog achieving fame and fortune has long
resonated in American folklore, and Mickey Mouse embodies this ideal.
Alongside him, his companion Minnie is also beloved, with their interactions
reflecting human courtship and innocence. Their timeless, carefree relationship
captures the purity of childhood, something children experience without
awareness and adults remember with nostalgia.
As a couple, Mickey and Minnie set a standard of socially acceptable
behavior among their animal friends. These characters serve as tools for
teaching children the basics of social interaction, with parents who grew up
watching Mickey happily introducing him to their own kids.
Mickey Mouse likely began as a fortunate creation of Walt Disney,
without the specific goal of becoming a role model. Yet, over time, he has
grown into a cultural icon in American society—and perhaps worldwide.
Through his films and the international Mickey Mouse Club, Mickey continues
to play a role in shaping well-rounded individuals.
Adapted from Symbols of America by Dent (1988, p. 53, as cited in Gardner, 1999)

Text 2

Mickey Mouse, Walt Disney’s famous creation, is celebrated worldwide
as a playful character who often gets into trouble but always finds a way out.
His quick thinking and cleverness are often seen as reflecting America's best
qualities (Dent 1988). However, while Mickey Mouse is often viewed as a
symbol of America, this association can be seen negatively rather than
positively.
Mickey’s global fame, much like that of Coca-Cola and McDonald’s, has
reached even the most remote parts of the world. This widespread influence,
driven by American marketing, represents a subtle form of cultural colonization,
arguably more dangerous than European colonialism. Unlike the more visible
and direct European colonialism, which could be resisted, Mickey Mouse’s
cultural reach is harder to detect and even more difficult to combat. While
European colonialism was supported by military power, the spread of Mickey
Mouse is driven by an equally strong cultural force that becomes deeply
ingrained in the societies it touches, making resistance more challenging in the
long term.
For much of the world, Mickey Mouse is not the lovable underdog
triumphing in a land of opportunity. He is not seen as a role model for children,
teaching them how to interact socially. Instead, he is viewed as a figure
imposing foreign social norms, fostering consumerism in countries that are not
economically prepared for it, and contributing to a form of cultural dependency.
Additionally, Mickey Mouse plays a role in promoting linguistic colonization.
Despite the narrative from within the United States, it is crucial to
consider Mickey Mouse’s impact from a global perspective. His influence has
often served as a precursor to the broader cultural colonization by America,
leaving lasting damage to the culture and society of many regions around the
world.
Adapted from Insidious Icons of Our Times by Souris (1990, p.109, as cited in Gardner,
1999)

Activity 3.4: Building an argument (cont.)

Share your summary with a student who read the parallel text to you and
discuss if your writer’s view of Micky Mouse is different to their writer’s view. If
you agree with either your writer’s view or the writer’s view of your partner, you
have formed a stance on Micky Mouse based on evidence from a source.

Activity 3.5: Building an argument (cont.)
Directions: Read the following text, note the position of the student who wrote

this piece and underline any structures or expressions used in order to express
their stance.
Dent (1988) claims, with little evidence, that Mickey Mouse is “a beloved
symbol of America's greatness” (p. 53), representing the best aspects of American life.
He emphasizes Mickey Mouse as a representation of the United States' prosperity and
political and economic dominance over the past fifty years. During this period, America
solidified its position as a global power through military conflicts, the space race, foreign
aid, and a strong dollar.
Souris (1990) concurs that Mickey Mouse reflects certain aspects of American
life but offers a more critical perspective, describing it as “a form of insidious
colonialism, far more harmful than the European colonialism of the past” (p. 109). Souris
argues that nineteenth-century European colonialism was easier to combat, whereas the
pervasive “Mickey Mouse colonialism” (p. 109) is much harder to overcome due to its
deeper integration into the invaded society. While Dent (1988) focuses solely on the
American context, Souris (1990) extends the argument to a global scale.
Dent (1988) argues that the rise of a seemingly powerless cartoon character
like Mickey Mouse to fame and fortune is a unique feature of American culture. He
connects this to the sense of freedom ingrained in American life, as reflected in the
Constitution. Souris (1990) does not deny this interpretation but emphasizes that
outside of the American context, Mickey Mouse is not an appropriate role model for
children. Instead, he encourages behaviors that are unacceptable in many other
cultures. Souris (1990) also highlights how Mickey Mouse promotes consumerism and
the spread of the English language, which may contribute to English becoming
dominant at the expense of other national languages.

Reporting Verbs in Communicating an Argument
The box below provides examples of how reporting verbs are used in
sentences to convey a writer's stance.
“Dent (1988) claims, with li1le evidence, that …”
“He demonstrates that …”
“…while Dent (1988) refers only to the American context Souris (1990)
shows that”

From the above example,
•

“Dent (1988) claims, with little evidence, that...” – The verb
“claims” suggests that the writer is skeptical of Dent's argument
and implies that it lacks sufficient support.

•

“He demonstrates that…” – The verb “demonstrates” suggests
that the writer finds the argument well-supported and persuasive.

•

“...while Dent (1988) refers only to the American context, Souris
(1990) shows that...” – The verb “ refers ” implies that Dent’s
argument is limited in scope, while “shows” suggests that
Souris’s argument is more compelling or well-founded.

These examples highlight how different verbs can subtly indicate the
writer’s position toward the cited author’s claims.
In Activity 3.5, you might notice that the writer uses certain verbs to
express their stance, such as “claim” and “argue.” The use of such reporting
verbs shows whether you support or doubt/contest the author you are
referencing. In addition to the reporting verbs in the table below, can you think
of other reporting verbs you know?

Presenting a strong argument to communicate
a good stance
The use of rebuttal or counter-argument is also used to present a
strong argument. It shows that the writer is able to consider contradicting
positions on their argument and still be convinced of their stance. This
communicates a well-informed stance to the reader and makes it more
convincing.
We often use the following expressions:
while, although, despite the fact that, however, even so, but
nevertheless, nonetheless, admittedly, it is true that…
Take a look at the following paragraph. How does the writer report the
sources in a way that supports his/her own argument?
It is often claimed that students are more easily motivated by authentic materials
since a great variety of topics can be chosen (e.g., Berardo, 2006; Richards, 2001).
However , in his review article, Gilmore (2007) concludes that this claim is not

supported by empirical evidence. Indeed, Peacock's (1997) empirical study of the
effects of authentic materials on the motivation of EFL learners at the beginner
level indicated that learners found authentic materials less interesting than artificial
ones. Therefore , authentic texts may not be necessarily more interesting than
inauthentic counterparts. When the topics are wisely chosen in accordance with
students' needs and interests, inauthentic materials can also stimulate their
motivation.

RESEARCH WRITING

83

From the text, it is evident that the reference at the end of Sentence 1
focuses on the content rather than the writer, as it presents widely held
knowledge. The writer’s stance is indicated by the use of "claimed," implying
that the point is not necessarily supported by evidence. Additionally, the writer
demonstrates knowledge of several sources, suggesting that they are about to
critique these assumptions.
In the second sentence, the writer uses the verb " concludes " to
present Gilmore’s criticism of the claim in Sentence 1. Gilmore's critique
appears in a review article, which is based on conclusions drawn from reviewing
multiple studies rather than original research findings.
Moreover, the writer employs a quite strong verb " indicated " to
present evidence they clearly agree with. Finally, the writer makes a comment
that states their own position and argument. It is important to note how the
writer hedges their comment with words like “may” and “can” to avoid making
the argument too strong.

Activity 3.6: Building an argument (cont.)
Directions: Read the following examples and notice the position of the linking

words.
Example 1: Since 1970 the number of students in Higher Education (HE) has increased

dramatically (Barton, 2010). Although widening participation in HE in the UK will require
higher levels of funding and resources, this will be more than offset by the substantial
increase in income from student fees (Roberts, 2013).
Example 2: These findings certainly show that children ate better in the 50’s than in the 90’s.

While there has been an improvement in the range and quality of food that has come onto
the market since that time, the research, nonetheless, highlights the depressing fact that
children nowadays eat far too much sugary and fatty food (Alexander, 2011).

Notice how this technique works:
1. the writer begins by selecting facts that point in a certain direction.
2. a particular contradictory ‘fact’ is presented that points to an opposite
conclusion.
3. this allows the writer to support the original point with an alternative
justification or evidence.

Essential Expressions used in Literature Reviews
A key characteristic of academic writing is its foundation on existing
knowledge, previous research, and established ideas or models. Therefore,
academic writers often refer to other studies and the work of various
authors. It is important for writers to guide readers through this body of
literature. Below are seven common expressions frequently used in
literature reviews.

1. Commenting on literature
The literature on XYZ has highlighted several issues …
More recent attention has focused on the issue of ...
The academic literature has revealed the emergence of XYZ
The existing literature is extensive and focuses particularly on XYZ
Much of the literature has emphasized the importance of XYZ

Commenting on literature through expressions like above
expressions can serve several purposes in a literature review:
1.1 Providing Context : By acknowledging what the existing literature has

covered, these expressions offer readers a contextual understanding of
the research contexts surrounding the topic under investigation. It helps
situate the current study within a broader academic conversation.
The literature on language acquisition has
highlighted several issues related to the role of

input frequency in vocabulary development among
bilingual children.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

1.2 Identifying Gaps and Trends: These expressions can signal shifts in

focus or emerging trends within the field. By noting where recent
attention or emphasis has been directed, researchers can identify gaps
in the literature or areas where further exploration is needed.
More recent attention in applied linguistics has
focused on the issue of computer-assisted language

learning and its impact on language proficiency in
second language learners.

Example

1.3 Highlighting Relevance: These expressions emphasize the significance

of the topic by showing that it has garnered attention and discussion
within the academic community. This helps justify the importance of the
current study and its contribution to the field.
The academic literature has revealed the

emergence of online language exchange platforms
as a new cont ext f or l anguage l ear ni ng and
intercultural communication.

Example

1.4 Establishing Continuity: These expressions demonstrate how the

current study builds upon previous research. They show that the
research is part of an ongoing dialogue and contributes to the
cumulative knowledge in the field.
Much of the l i terature in sociolinguistics has
emphasized the importance of language variation

and its implications for identity construction among
multilingual communities.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

2. Discussing areas investigated in previous research
To date, several studies have investigated on XYZ.
A great deal of previous research into XYZ has focused on ...
Numerous studies (e.g., XXXX, YYYY) have attempted to explain …
Discussing areas investigated in previous research through these
expressions can serve several purposes in a literature review:
2.1 Demonstrating Existing Knowledge : By acknowledging previous

studies that have explored similar or related topics, these expressions
establish a foundation of existing knowledge. They show that the topic
has been studied before and provide a starting point for understanding
the current research.
To date, several studies have investigated the

impact of digital language lear ning tools on
vocabulary acquisition in second language learners.

Example

2.2 Highlighting Research Trends : These expressions can indicate

common themes or trends in the literature. By mentioning the focus of
previous research, researchers can identify recurring topics or questions
that have shaped the academic discourse on the subject.
A great deal of previous research into language

anxiety among English language learners has
focused on its effects on speaking proficiency and

classroom participation

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

89

2.3 Identifying Gaps and Opportunities: By summarizing the existing body

of research, these expressions can help identify gaps or areas where
further investigation is needed. Researchers can use this information to
position their own study within the broader context of existing literature
and to justify the need for their research.
Numerous studies (e.g., Smith, 2017; Johnson,
2019) have attempted to explain the relationship

between language exposure in early childhood and
bilingual language development later in life.

Example

2.4 Establishing Credibility : By referencing previous studies, researchers

demonstrate their awareness of the relevant literature and establish
credibility with readers. This shows that the current study is informed by
existing research and contributes to an ongoing scholarly conversation.
B y re f e re n c i n g n u m e ro u s s t u d i e s t h a t h a v e
examined language anxiety in classroom settings,

the current research not only acknowledges the
established body of work but also seeks to build
upon it by exploring anxiety in virtual language
learning environments.

90

RESEARCH WRITING

3.1 Crediting Original Work : By attributing findings or insights to

specific authors and years, researchers acknowledge the original
contributions of those scholars. This gives credit where it is due and
respects the intellectual property of previous researchers.
Smith and Jones (2018) demonstrated that explicit
vocabulary instruction led to significant
improvements in students’ language proficiency.

Example

3.2 Highlighting Key Findings: These expressions help draw attention

to important findings or conclusions from previous studies. By
summarizing what specific authors have reported or demonstrated,
researchers can highlight key insights that are relevant to their own
research.
In a study by Garcia (2016), it was reported that
bilingual education programs had a positive impact
on students’ language development and academic
achievement.

Example

3.3 Supporting Claims and Arguments : Referencing specific studies

and authors provides evidence to support the claims and arguments
made in the literature review. By citing reputable sources,
researchers bolster the credibility of their own work and
demonstrate that their arguments are grounded in existing
scholarship.
By referencing Brown (2018), who reported that

immersive language experiences lead to higher
levels of fluency, this study supports the argument
that real-world practice is essential for effective
language learning.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

91

3.4 Tracing Intellectual Lineages : These expressions help trace the

intellectual lineage of ideas or theories. By referencing earlier
studies that have contributed to a particular line of research,
researchers show how their work fits into a broader academic
tradition and builds upon the foundation laid by previous scholars.
Building on the work of Taylor (2001), who first

identified the importance of context in language
comprehension, subsequent studies have expanded
this concept to include digital contexts (Patel, 2019).

Example

4. Referencing another writer’s idea or position
argues

maintains
points out
Referencing another writer’s idea or position through such
expressions can serve several purposes in the literature review:
4.1 Attribution and Academic Integrity : By clearly attributing ideas or

positions to specific authors and providing citations, researchers uphold
academic integrity and avoid plagiarism. This demonstrates respect for
the intellectual contributions of others and maintains transparency in
scholarly discourse.
Chomsky (1957) argues that language acquisition is
supported by an innate language acquisition device,
allowing kids to learn language quickly and with
minimal direct instruction.

Example

92

RESEARCH WRITING

4.2 Engagement with Existing Scholarship : Referencing other authors’

arguments or claims shows that researchers have engaged critically with
existing scholarship in their field. It allows them to situate their own
work within the broader academic conversation and demonstrate an
awareness of the diverse perspectives and debates that shape their
topic.
Smith (2015) suggests that bilingual education
fosters cognitive flexibility, while others (e.g.,
Adams, 2017) challenge this claim by highlighting

methodological flaws in existing studies.

Example

4.3 Supporting or Challenging Perspectives : Researchers may reference

other authors to support their own arguments or to challenge prevailing
perspectives. By citing authors who hold similar or contrasting views,
researchers can strengthen their own position and provide a nuanced
understanding of the topic under investigation.
By referencing Davis (2019) , who maintains that

early language immersion is crucial for fluency, this
s t udy s uppor t s t he argument t hat l anguage
acquisition is most effective when started at a young
age. Conversely, Lee (2020) challenges this notion
by showing that adult learners can achieve
comparable proficiency with the right teaching
methods.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

93

4.4 Providing Context and Background: Referencing other authors’ ideas

helps provide context and background information for readers
unfamiliar with the topic. It allows researchers to summarize key
arguments or positions in the literature and guide readers through the
scholarly conversation.
Jones (2018) points out that language learning is
influenced by both internal cognitive factors and
external social contexts, which provides a foundation
for understanding the multifaceted nature of
language acquisition that this study aims to explore
further.

Example

5. Synthesizing material by supporting evidence or ideas
Similarly, Author (YEAR) found that ...
This is consistent with Author (YEAR) who found that ...
Supporting this view, Author (YEAR) maintains that ...
The purpose of synthesizing material by supporting evidence or
ideas through such expressions is to build a cohesive narrative within the
literature review. This approach serves several important functions:
5.1 Demonstrating Consensus or Agreement : By highlighting studies or

authors that have reached similar conclusions or findings, researchers
demonstrate the consensus or agreement within the scholarly
community on certain aspects of the topic. This helps reinforce the
credibility of their own arguments by showing that their perspectives
are supported by existing research.
Similarly, Ellis (2005) found that explicit instruction in

grammar rules led to greater accuracy in language
production among second language learners.

Example

94

RESEARCH WRITING

5.2 Providing Corroborating Evidence : Synthesizing material with

supporting evidence or ideas from multiple sources provides
corroborating evidence for the claims made in the literature review. This
reinforces the credibility of the arguments made and increases the
overall persuasiveness of the review.
Supporting this view , Larsen-Freeman (2003)

maintains that language acquisition is a complex and
multifaceted process that involves interaction
between various cognitive, affective, and social
factors.

Example

5.3 Creating a Unified Narrative : By synthesizing material in this way,

researchers create a unified narrative that integrates various
perspectives and findings into a coherent whole. This helps readers
understand the broader context of the topic and how different studies
or theories relate to each other.
R e s e a rc h c o n s i s t e n t l y s h o w s the benefits of

collaborative learning in language acquisition. For
instance, Lee (2016) demonstrated improvements in
speaking fluency through group work, which aligns
with Anderson (2017), who highlighted enhanced
listening skills in peer-to-peer activities. Together,
these findings suggest that collaborative methods
are widely effective.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

95

5.4 Highlighting Key Themes or Trends : Synthesizing material allows

researchers to identify key themes or trends in the literature. By
grouping together studies or authors with similar findings or viewpoints,
researchers can highlight these overarching themes and provide a
comprehensive overview of the topic.
Many studies have focused on the role of cultural
context in language learning. For example, Chen
(2015) emphasized the importance of cultural
immersion in language proficiency, and Park (2018)
found that students exposed to cultural narratives in
their language studies showed greater engagement
and comprehension. These trends highlight the
integral role that cultural factors play in effective
language acquisition.

Example

6. Synthesizing material by contrasting evidence or ideas
Unlike Author1 (YEAR), Author2 (YEAR) argues that ...
This result conflicts with Author’s (YEAR) study which found that …
While Author1 (YEAR) focuses on X, Author2 (YEAR) is more concerned with Y.

The purpose of synthesizing material by contrasting evidence or
ideas through such expressions is to provide a nuanced and comprehensive
understanding of the topic, especially in the other angle, within the
literature review. This approach serves several important functions:

96

RESEARCH WRITING

6.1 Highlighting Diverse Perspectives: By contrasting different studies

or authors with conflicting findings or viewpoints, researchers
acknowledge the diversity of perspectives within the scholarly
literature. This helps readers understand the range of opinions and
interpretations surrounding the topic.
Unlike Johnson (2010), who argued that explicit

grammar instruction is essential for second language
acquisition, Smith (2015) contends that a focus on
communicative language teaching is more effective
in promoting language fluency and proficiency.
Example

6.2 Encouraging Critical Thinking : Synthesizing material in this way

encourages critical thinking by prompting readers to consider the
strengths and limitations of different studies or arguments. By
presenting contrasting evidence or ideas, researchers invite readers
to critically evaluate the evidence and form their own informed
opinions.
This result conflicts with the findings of a meta-

analysis by Lee et al. (2018), which found a significant
positive correlation between explicit grammar
instruction and language learning outcomes.
Example

6.3 Identifying Gaps or Inconsistencies: Contrasting evidence or ideas

can help researchers identify gaps or inconsistencies in the
literature. By highlighting areas where there is disagreement or
conflicting evidence, researchers can identify areas for further
research or exploration.
While Brown (2008) focuses on the role of individual

learner differences in language acquisition, Garcia
(2012) is more concerned with the sociocultural
factors that influence language development in
multilingual contexts.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

97

7. Summarizing the review or parts of the review
Taken together, previous studies highlight the need for ...
Overall, previous studies show / suggest / indicate / highlight …
Together these studies provide important insights into ...

The purpose of summarizing the review or parts of the review
through such expressions is to provide a cohesive and concise overview of
the key findings, themes, or implications derived from the reviewed
literature. This approach serves several important functions:

7.1 Synthesizing Key Points : By summarizing the key findings or

themes across multiple studies, researchers provide readers with a
clear and concise overview of the state of the literature on the topic.
This helps readers understand the main conclusions or implications
derived from the reviewed studies.
Taken together, previous studies highlight the need

for more research into the effectiveness of taskbas ed l anguage t eachi ng i n promot i ng or al
proficiency among young learners.

Example

7.2 Identifying Trends or Patterns : Summarizing the review allows

researchers to identify trends or patterns that emerge across
multiple studies. By synthesizing the findings of different studies,
researchers can identify common themes or recurring patterns in
the literature.
O v e r a l l , previous studies s u g g e s t a growing

emphasis on the role of cultural context in language
acquisition, indicating a trend towards understanding
language learning as a socially situated practice.
Example

98

RESEARCH WRITING

7.3 Providing Closure: Summarizing the review provides closure to the

literature review section by summarizing the main points or
conclusions derived from the reviewed studies. This helps readers
understand the main takeaways from the literature review and how
they contribute to the overall understanding of the topic.
Together, these studies provide important insights

into the effectiveness of different language learning
strategies, helping to clarify which methods are most
beneficial under specific conditions.

Example

7.4 Highlighting Implications for Future Research : Summarizing the

review can also highlight implications for future research. By
summarizing the main findings or gaps identified in the literature,
researchers can suggest areas for further research or exploration,
which could lead to your study.
Overall, the reviewed literature highlights several
gaps in understanding the long-term effects of

immersive language experiences, pointing to a need
for longitudinal studies that explore sustained
language use over time.

Example

Writing and Critical Appraisal of Literature Review
C r i t i c a l a p p r a i s a l is the process of

carefully and systematically evaluating research
to determine its reliability, significance, and
relevance to a particular context (Burls, 2023).
This process is crucial in literature writing
because it extends beyond merely summarizing
previous studies.

What is Research?
“Why did the researcher bring a compass to the library?
Because they were lost in the maze of research designs!”

At its core, ‘research’ is about seeking answers to questions, a
process we continually engage in to better understand our surroundings
(Dörnyei, 2007). For instance, if you are searching for a bag at the lowest
price, you might visit several stores or browse different online shopping
platforms to compare prices and find the best deal.
A researcher does not onl y choose between qual i tati ve,
quantitative, or mixed methods; they also select a specific type of study
within these approaches. Research designs are specific types of inquiry
within these methodologies that guide the procedures of a research study.

1. Quantitative Design (QUAN)
Quantitative research design focuses on data collection methods
that yield primarily numerical data, which are analyzed using statistical
techniques. This approach is often used to investigate or determine
relationships between variables. Researchers use variables to represent
what they are investigating, such as language proficiency or motivation,
and employ objective measures or tests to gather data. One of the common
examples of this design is survey research using a questionnaire, with the
data analyzed by statistical software.

2. Qualitative Design (QUAL)
Qualitative research design focuses on data collection methods that
produce open-ended, non-numerical data, which are analyzed using nonstatistical techniques. This approach is typically used to explore language,
language learning, or social phenomena within their natural contexts, such
as social or classroom environments. An example of qualitative research is
conducting interviews, where the transcribed recordings are examined
using qualitative content analysis.

108

RESEARCH WRITING

3. Mixed-methods Design
A mixed-methods design integrates both qualitative and
quantitative research methods, either during data collection or analysis.
This approach suggests that combining the two can improve the quality of
a study, as one method can support, complement, or provide deeper
insights into the findings of the other. However, mixed-methods design
involves more than merely adding quantitative data to qualitative data. It
requires a clear rationale and thoughtful decisions on how to integrate the
two methodologies appropriately. An example of this design is conducting
sequential and interrelated questionnaire and interview studies.

Research Methodological Debate
Over the years, extensive discussions and debates have taken place
regarding research methodology and the theory of inquiry. A significant
portion of this debate has focused on whether qualitative or quantitative
inquiry is superior and which is more ‘scientific.’
The popularity of different methodologies varies across social,
political, historical, and cultural contexts. Each methodology has its own
strengths and weaknesses, which should be acknowledged and addressed

by researchers.

Ensure that the researchers avoid the common misconception, held
by both novice and experienced researchers, that quantitative research is
inherently superior to qualitative research. Neither approach is better than
the other; they are simply different, each with its own strengths and
weaknesses. The effectiveness of both methodologies largely depends on
the researcher's skills, training, and experience.

Thought-provoking Activity:

Discuss your methodological ideas with your classmates. Consider their
opinions and assess their reactions. If you choose to pursue a methodology
that they are unfamiliar with or disagree with, be ready to justify your
choice. This requires thorough reflection and careful consideration.

Characteristics of Research Methods Section
The research methods section of a scholarly paper serves as the
blueprint for the entire research process (Pandey & Pandey, 2021). Its main

purpose is to offer readers a clear and thorough explanation of how the
study was carried out, detailing the methodologies used, the data

112

RESEARCH WRITING

collection procedures, and the analysis techniques applied. A wellconstructed research methods section exhibits five key characteristics.

1. Clarity and Transparency: The methods section should be written
clearly and concisely, minimizing the use of jargon and technical
terms when possible. It should include enough detail for readers to
fully comprehend how the research was conducted and how the
data were analyzed.

2. Coherence and Organization : The information presented in the
methods section should be logically organized and flow smoothly
from one subsection to the next. Each component of the research
process should be addressed in a systematic way, enabling readers
to easily follow the study's progression from the initial stages to its
final conclusions.

3. Accuracy and Precision : Accuracy is of prime importance in the
methods section, as any inaccuracies or omissions could undermine
the credibility of the study. Researchers must ensure that all relevant
details regarding the research design, sampling procedures, data
collection instruments, and analytical methods are accurately
reported.

4. Reproducibility and Replicability : The methods section should
include enough detail to enable other researchers to replicate the
study if they wish to do so. This includes detailed descriptions of
the procedures used, as well as any materials or resources employed
in the research process.

5. Ethical Considerations: Researchers should also address any ethical
considerations related to the study, such as informed consent
procedures, confidentiality protections, and any potential risks or
benefits to participants. Transparency regarding ethical practices is
essential for maintaining the integrity of the research.

RESEARCH WRITING

Example (extract from Joo et al., 2023)
3.1 Participants
The current study adopted a non-probability sampling design (Wiersma
& Jurs, 2005). In order to examine K-SBA’s functionality, it was important to
recruit participants from a wide range of Korean proficiency levels. Therefore,
82 undergraduate and graduate students were recruited from a Korean
Language Program (KLP) at a US university. They were enrolled in courses
according to their proficiency level: from 2nd-year (low-intermediate or CEFR
A2) to 5th-year (advanced or CEFR C2) Korean. Out of the 82 participants who
took part in this assessment, 51 completed the test and gave consent to
participate in the study. As summarized in Fig. 1, there were 28 2nd-year, 13
3rd-year, nine 4th-year, and one 5th-year student. Among the 51 examinees,
23 were non-heritage, and 28 were heritage learners (See Fig. 2).

Example (extract from Chen et al., 2022)
3.2. Participants

Originally, a total of 74 undergraduate students participated in this study. One
male participant from Chinese group was removed because he has taken only
78 seconds to finish all the experiment. One female participant from the
Spanish group was removed because she selected the same option for all the
items. In the end, data from 72 participants were involved in the following
correlation and path analysis. Among them, 35 of the students were from a
Chinese university (24 females and 11 males) and were all native Chinese
speakers. 37 (20 females and 17 males) of the students were from a Spanish
university and were all native Spanish speakers. The students were all EFL
learners and were asked to fill in a self-rating questionnaire (1 = poor, 7 =
proficient) about their English language proficiency. Both Chinese and Spanish
participants rated their English level as intermediate (M = 4.49, SD = 0.89, for
Chinese participants; M = 4.59, SD = 1.07, for Spanish participants). Participants
ranged in age from 18 to 23 years old (M = 20.63, SD = 0.97, for Chinese; M =
20.70, SD = 1.08, for Spanish)

3. Research Instruments
In the Data Collection section, 'instrumentation' refers to the tools
or measures researchers use to gather data for their study. This part of the
Research Methodology section should include a comprehensive discussion
of the instruments and materials employed for data collection, with
attention to their validity and reliability. Researchers should also outline the
procedures and techniques used to gather data. This provides readers with
insights into how the research data were obtained, ensuring transparency
and reproducibility in the research process. The following components
should be included in this subsection:
3.1 Description of Instruments: Provide a thorough description of each

data collection instrument or tool used in the study. This may
include tests, questionnaires, interviews, observations, databases,
or media sources.
The data collection instruments used in this study
included a structured questionnaire to assess
participants’ demographic information and a Likertscale questionnaire to measure their attitudes
towards the research topic. Additionally, semistructured interviews were conducted to gather indept h qual i tat i ve i nsi ght s i nt o parti ci pants’
experiences and perspectives.

Example

3.2 Validity and Reliability : Discuss the validity and reliability of each

data collection instrument, addressing the extent to which the
instrument measures what it is intended to measure and produces
consistent results over time.
The validity of the questionnaire was established
through a thorough review by a panel of experts in
the field, who assessed its relevance, clarity, and
comprehensiveness. Reliability was assessed through
a test-retest method, with a subset of participants
completing the questionnaire on two separate
occasions, yielding consistent results.

3.2. Materials
The main research instrument was an online questionnaire (see Appendix A)
targeting three sets of information: (a) participants’ experience and background in L2
learning and teaching, (b) their beliefs about the teaching of L2 pronunciation, and (c)
their speech assessments. For participant background, the questionnaire elicited
participants’ past and current experiences, including their language learning history
(e.g., age of onset of L2 learning, context, length of study). Participants also indicated
whether their experience involved English teaching, pronunciation-specific training
opportunities, or linguistic coursework (including phonetics and phonology), and
recorded both the length and the type of these activities. Additionally, those who had
resided abroad for more than one month reported the length, location, and purpose of
the visit. Participants’ beliefs about pronunciation teaching were elicited using a 15-item
teacher beliefs questionnaire adapted from Nagle et al. (2018) by changing any
wordings related to L2 Spanish to fit the context of teaching English in Japan, and then
translated into Japanese (Tsunemoto et al., 2023). The 15 items collectively focus on the
importance of pronunciation teaching, its timing and effectiveness, teachers’
pedagogical goals, and approaches to addressing pronunciation issues. As part of a
larger project, teachers answered eight additional questions (not discussed here) about
their L2 pronunciation teaching goals (Foote et al., 2011), ideal L2 pronunciation
teaching models (Henderson et al., 2012), and self-estimated preparedness for teaching
specific pronunciation features (Buss, 2016).
Short audios by 40 Japanese secondary school students (M_age = 16.13 years,
range = 16-17) recorded as part of an earlier study (Tsunemoto, 2017) were used for the
speech rating task. The audios featured only male speakers (to control for possible
gender effects on rating) describing a job they would like to do in the future. The
speaking prompt was modeled after an IELTS long-turn task (Jakeman & McDowell,
2008) and was considered appropriate for Japanese students familiar with standardized
exams. The 40 speakers represented a range of L2 speaking skills, as estimated through
9-point scalar ratings of comprehensibility (M = 4.81, range = 2.67-7.33) and
accentedness (M = 3.95, range = 2.00-6.83) by raters from the United Kingdom (4
males, 2 females) in the earlier study.

Example (extract from Marzuki et al., 2023)
3.3. Instrument
We used interviews as our research instrument to collect the required data for this study.
This instrument allowed us to gather rich, qualitative data related to EFL teachers’ use
of AI writing tools, and their perspectives on the impact of these tools on students’
writing quality—specifically, in terms of content and organization. To construct pertinent
interview questions, we turned to several relevant pieces of literature. Works by Nazari
et al. (2021), Dale and Viethen (2021), M. Lee et al. (2022), and Zhao (2022) served as
valuable references. By undertaking an in-depth review of these sources, we focused on
the topics and themes that aligned with our research objectives.

3.3. Data collection and scoring procedures

The K-SBA was administered online via the online survey platform,
Qualtrics. The examinees had to install the extension of an online proctoring
software, Honorlock, on their Google Chrome browser. Honorlock blocked the
students from navigating other websites and using dictionaries, grammar, or spellcheck functions. It also allowed the examinees' activities to be monitored through
screen and video recording. The test administrators were able to track the
examinees' test progress in real-time via Honorlock. The administrators were
available for all test slots to respond to the examinees' questions or requests via
email. While there was no time limit, it took examinees 2.5 hours to complete the
entire K-SBA and 7 minutes for each writing task on average.
Examinees' response data were retrieved from Qualtrics and scored by
four raters. Four Korean native speakers with extensive rating experience in L2
assessment were recruited to score the examinees' responses. Using a rating
connectivity design, each rater was assigned 25-26 examinees to judge, and each
response was assigned two ratings.

In Data Analysis, you detail the procedures and techniques used to
analyze the collected data. This section provides readers with insights into
how the data were processed, interpreted, and transformed into meaningful
findings. The following components should be included in this subsection:
5.1 Data Processing: Describe the steps taken to organize and prepare

the raw data for analysis, including data cleaning, coding, and
transformation procedures.
Prior to analysis, the raw data were checked for
accuracy and completeness. Missing values were
identified and handled using [method], and outliers
were identified and removed using [method]. Data
were then coded according to [coding scheme] to
facilitate analysis.

Example

5.2 Statistical Analysis (Quantitative Studies) : Explain the statistical

methods used to analyze the quantitative data, including descriptive
statistics, inferential statistics, and any specialized analyses
conducted.
Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive
statistics to summarize the central tendency, variability,
and distribution of variables. Inferential statistics,
including [name of statistical tests], were employed to
test hypotheses and determine relationships among
variables. All statistical analyses were conducted using
[software program] with a significance level of α = 0.05.

Example

128

RESEARCH WRITING

5.3 Qualitative Analysis (Qualitative Studies) : Detail the qualitative

analysis techniques used to interpret the qualitative data, such as
thematic analysis, content analysis, or narrative analysis.
Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis,
following the steps outlined by [author]. Transcripts
were coded line-by-line to identify recurring themes
and patterns. Codes were then grouped into higherorder themes, and thematic maps were created to
visualize relationships among themes.

Example

5.4 Integration of Data (Mixed-Methods Studies) : Explain how the

quantitative and qualitative data were integrated or triangulated to
provide an understanding of the research problem.
In this mixed-methods study, quantitative and
qualitative data were analyzed separately and then
integrated during the interpretation phase. Convergent
findings were identified to validate and corroborate
each other, while divergent findings were explored to
gain deeper insights into the research problem.

Example

5.5 Validity and Reliability : Outline the steps taken to ensure the

accuracy and consistency of the data analysis. This might include
methods such as inter-coder reliability checks to ensure consistency
in data coding, member checking to confirm findings with
participants, or triangulation of different data sources to cross-verify
the results.
To ensure the validity and reliability of the qualitative
analysis, two independent coders coded a subset of
transcripts, and inter-coder reliability was assessed
using [method]. Any discrepancies were resolved
through discussion until consensus was reached.
Additionally, member checking was conducted to
validate the accuracy and interpretation of findings
with participants.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

129

Including these, you could provide transparency and rigor in
documenting the analytical process, enabling readers to evaluate the
validity and credibility of the study’s findings.
Example (extract from Marzuki et al., 2023)
3.5. Data analysis

We employed a thematic case study to analyze the qualitative data. As outlined
by Braun and Clarke (2006), the goal of this thematic analysis was to identify patterns
and connections among themes extracted from the qualitative data, thereby addressing
our research questions. We divided the analysis into five distinct steps.
In the first step, we thoroughly read the interview transcript multiple times to
familiarize ourselves with its content. The second step involved developing preliminary
codes that grouped related words and phrases in line with our research criteria.
Following a detailed analysis of these codes, we then categorized each one. In this step,
we also compared the results to identify any relationships or patterns. Finally, we
established a set of categories from these grouped codes.

Example (extract from Tegge, 2017)
3.3. Data analysis

The computer program used to analyze the lexical profile of the song corpora
was RANGE (Heatley, Nation, & Coxhead, 2002). RANGE counts the number of times a
word occurs in a corpus. Results are presented as tokens, types, and word families. In
addition, RANGE lists the word families according to their frequency in wordlists used
during the analysis. For this purpose, Nation's (2004, 2006) twenty BNC wordlists were
used, which allowed for the assessment of the overall vocabulary load of the song
corpora.
When analyzing songs, it needs to be kept in mind that written lyrics are often
intended to reflect characteristics of spoken language and frequently contain a high
number of contractions (e.g. I've, can't), connected speech (e.g. shoulda, woulda,
coulda) and apostrophized abbreviations (e.g. lovin’). The RANGE program (Heatley et
al., 2002) automatically separates contractions. For example, can't is counted as two
words, that is, as can and not. Connected speech, on the other hand, is counted as one
word. For example, coulda is counted as a family member of can. Apostrophized
abbreviations were manually added to the frequency lists used in the analysis. For
example, lovin’ was subsumed under the lemma love. Quasi-transcriptions of spoken
variations of words such as ya (you) or cuz (because) were added to their respective
word families.

6. Ethical Considerations
In the “Ethical Considerations” sub-section of the Research
Methodology section, researchers detail the ethical principles and
guidelines adhered to throughout the research process. This section is
essential for protecting participants’ rights, dignity, and well-being, while
also ensuring that the research is conducted with integrity and transparency.
The following components should be included in this subsection:
6.1 Informed Consent: Describe how informed consent was obtained

from participants, including details on how participants were
informed about the nature and purpose of the study, their rights
as participants, and any potential risks or benefits involved.

RESEARCH WRITING

131

Participants were provided with a written informed
consent form outlining the purpose of the study, the
voluntary nature of participation, and their rights as
participants. Prior to data collection, participants were
given ample time to review the consent form and ask
any questions before providing their written consent.

Example

6.2 Confidentiality and Anonymity : Describe the steps taken to

protect participant confidentiality and anonymity during the
research. This includes measures to ensure that participants'
identities and responses were kept confidential and safeguarded,
such as using pseudonyms, securely storing data, and restricting
access to identifiable information.
To protect participant confidentiality, all data collected
were anonymized, and participants were assigned
pseudonyms in any reports or publications.
Additionally, measures were taken to ensure that any
identifying information was securely stored and
accessible only to authorized personnel.

Example

6.3 Protection of Participants: Explain the steps taken to reduce any

potential harm or discomfort to participants throughout the
research process. This includes precautions to safeguard
vulnerable groups, such as ensuring informed consent, providing
the option to withdraw at any time, and offering support if any
emotional or psychological discomfort arises.

Extra attention was given to ensuring participants' wellbeing during the study. Support service contact
information was provided, and debriefing sessions
were made available to address any concerns or
emotional responses that may have emerged during
their participation.

What is Data?
“Collecting data is like trying to gather ingredients for a recipe you’ve never heard of –
you might end up with a few surprises along the way,
but hopefully, it all comes together in the end.”

When your research is designed, it is time to start the project to
collect data. Prior to collecting data, it is important to think about sampling
of your participants. Then you can proceed to the next stage, which is data
collection.

1. Sampling
When conducting research, it is often impractical to observe or
collect data from every individual within a population. Instead, researchers
must find a representative subset of the population to study. In research
terminology, the population refers to the entire group of interest, while the
sample is the representative segment from which information is collected.

For large populations, collecting data from every member is unfeasible. For
example, if you are researching Thai EFL undergraduate students, gathering
data from the entire population would be challenging. Therefore,
researchers use a shortcut by collecting data from representative samples.
This procedure is known as sampling (see Fig. 5.1). Sampling allows
researchers to make generalizations based on careful observations of a
smaller, manageable group.

138

RESEARCH WRITING

1.1 Sampling Methods
Sampling methods can be categorized into two main types:
probability sampling and non-probability sampling . In probability

sampling, every member of the population has a known likelihood of being
chosen. Common techniques include simple random sampling, systematic
random sampling, and stratified random sampling.
On the other hand, non-probability sampling involves selecting
samples through non-random methods. This includes techniques such as
convenience sampling, quota sampling, judgment sampling, and snowball
sampling. A major limitation of non-probability sampling is the difficulty in
assessing how representative the sample is of the overall population, which
complicates the estimation of sampling errors. Non-probability sampling is
generally more common in qualitative research.

1.1.1 Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

Simple random sampling is the most straightforward type of
probability sampling, where every member of the population has an equal
opportunity of being selected. This method helps reduce selection bias

and makes the sampling process easier. To carry out simple random
sampling, different techniques can be employed, including using a random
number table, the lottery method, or computer-generated random
numbers. Each population member is assigned a unique number, and
random numbers are chosen either manually or with software until the
desired sample size is achieved.
Suppose you want to survey the learning satisfaction of
undergraduate students in one public university with
3000 students. You can assign a number to each
employee from 1 to 3000 and then use a random
number generator to select 50 students for your
sample.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

139

1.1.2 Systematic Random Sampling

Systematic random sampling is a method in which members of a
population are selected at regular intervals . This approach helps achieve
an even distribution of the sample throughout the population. To
implement this method, first calculate the sampling interval (k) by dividing
the population size (N) by the desired sample size (n). Then, select a
random starting point between 1 and k, and proceed to choose every kth
element from the population list. For example, if k is 5 and the random
starting point is 3, you would select the 3rd, 8th, 13th, and so on, members
of the population (see Fig. 5.2 below).

Figure 5.2 Systematic Random Sampling

In a faculty with 500 students, if you need a sample of
50 students, your sampling interval (k) would be 10
(500/50). Starting randomly at student number 7, you
would then select every 10th student thereafter (i.e., 7,
17, 27, ...).

Example
1.1.3 Stratiﬁed Random Sampling

Stratified random sampling involves splitting the population into
smaller groups, or strata, based on shared characteristics or attributes. This

140

RESEARCH WRITING

method ensures that each subgroup is sufficiently represented in the
sample, resulting in more accurate data. To use this approach, first identify
the relevant strata within the population, such as age, gender, or income
level. Then, apply simple random sampling within each stratum to select
members for the sample (see Fig. 5.3). The sample size from each stratum
can be proportional to its size in the overall population or equal across
strata, depending on the research goals.

Figure 5.3 Stratified Random Sampling

If you’re studying voter behavior across different
income levels in a city, you might divide the population
into three income brackets: low, middle, and high. You
would then perform simple random sampling within
each bracket to ensure that each income level is
adequately represented in your study.

Example

In contrast, non-probability sampling methods are used in research
when it is not feasible to use probability sampling, typically due to
limitations like lack of a clear sampling frame, time constraints, or budget
restrictions. In this section, we will examine four common non-probability
sampling methods: convenience sampling, quota sampling, judgment
sampling, and snowball sampling, using examples from the field of
language studies.

RESEARCH WRITING

141

1.1.4 Convenience Sampling

Convenience sampling entails selecting participants who are the
easiest to reach and willing to participate in the study. This method is the

simplest and most cost-effective but may introduce considerable bias. It
involves choosing individuals who are readily available, without attempting
to make the representative of the population.
In a study to understand bilingual language acquisition
among children, a researcher might choose to observe
children at a nearby school where they have easy
access and permissions, rather than seeking a more
diverse and representative sample from various
regions.

Example
1.1.5 Quota Sampling

Quota sampling involves dividing the population into mutually
exclusive sub-groups, much like stratified sampling, and then nonrandomly selecting participants from each segment to meet predetermined

quotas. To implement this method, first deter mine the traits or
characteristics relevant to the study’s goals, such as age, gender, or
language proficiency. Then, fill each quota using methods like convenience
or judgment sampling.
In researching language decay in minority languages, a
researcher may establish quotas to ensure that different
a g e g ro u p s , g e n d e r s , a n d l e v e l s o f l a n g u a g e
proficiency within the community are adequately
represented. They then select participants from local
community centers and social groups to meet these
quotas.

Example

142

RESEARCH WRITING

1.1.6 Judgment Sampling (or Purposive Sampling)

Judgment sampling, also known as purposive sampling, involves
the researcher using their expertise and knowledge of the population to
select participants. This method relies on the researcher’s judgment to
choose cases that are believed to be typical or representative of the
population. To apply this approach, identify the key characteristics that
participants must possess (inclusion criteria ) and select individuals who
best meet these criteria. Clearly defining the inclusion criteria ensures that
the selected participants are appropriate for the study.
When researching the acquisition of a second language
in adults, a researcher might selectively invite
individuals who have moved to a new country and have
been learning the language for exactly two to three
years, believing these participants best represent the
typical experiences of language learners.

Example
1.1.7 Snowball Sampling

Snowball sampling is used particularly in populations that are
difficult to access. Researchers begin with a small group of known
individuals and ask them to refer others who meet the study criteria. Doing
this, start with a few key informants, and as you gather data, ask them to
suggest other people who qualify for the study (see Fig. 5.4). This method
can rapidly increase the number of participants through referrals.

In a study on the use of slang among speakers of urban
dialects, a linguist might start with a few informants
known to them and use these connections to reach
more speakers within the community, allowing the
sample to grow “like a snowball.”

2. Types of Data
In research, data types or levels of measurement are fundamental
concepts that define how variables are categorized, counted, and
mathematically treated. These scales include nominal , ordinal , interval ,
and ratio, each with distinct characteristics and appropriate uses. Here, we
will explore each type with examples relevant to language studies.

2.1 Nominal Scale
The nominal scale categorizes data into distinct groups where each
category is mutually exclusive, meaning that no order or ranking can be
applied. This scale is purely qualitative and is used for categorization or
labeling variables, without any quantitative value.
In language studies, a researcher might use the
nominal scale to categorize respondents based on

their first language. For example, categories might
include English, French, Mandarin, and others. Each
language represents a distinct category without any
intrinsic ordering.

Example

2.2 Ordinal Scale
The ordinal scale offers more information than the nominal scale by
not only categorizing the data but also establishing a ranking among the
categories. However, this scale does not measure the exact difference
between the ranks—it only tells us that one rank is higher or lower than
another.
An example from language studies could be the
proficiency level of language learners. Learners might
be classified into categories such as Beginner,
Intermediate, and Advanced. These categories indicate
a progression in learning, but the differences between
these levels are not uniform or specifically quantified.
Example

146

RESEARCH WRITING

2.3 Interval Scale
Interval scales are numerical scales where the intervals between
values are equal, but they do not have a true zero point. This scale allows
for the measurement of the magnitude of differences between items, but
not the ratio between them. The examples include scores.
A common example in language studies using interval
scales might be the scores on a standardized language
test, such as TOEFL, IELTS or TU-GET. The scores are
measured on an equal interval scale , where the

difference between scores directly reflects differences
in ability. However, a score of zero does not imply a
complete absence of language ability, merely that the
ability is below the measurement threshold of the test.
Example

2.4 Ratio Scale
The ratio scale includes all the characteristics of an interval scale,
along with the important distinction of having an absolute zero point. This
zero point allows for the comparison of absolute magnitudes and the
computation of ratios, making it the most informative scale. The examples
include height, weight, income, and age.
An example in language studies might be the number
of words a student learns in a specific period, such as a
semester. This is a ratio scale because a count of zero
words learned means no learning occurred, and ratios
(e.g., one student learning twice as many words as
another) are meaningful.

3. Quantitative Data Collection
Quantitative data collection methods are structured approaches
used to obtain measurable and statistically analyzable data. These
methods are essential in research for providing objective data that can be
quantified and used for statistical analysis to establish patterns, test
hypotheses, and make predictions. In this section, we will explore some of
the main quantitative data collection methods, highlighting their
application in research and providing examples from the field of language
studies.

3.1 Surveys and Questionnaires
In language studies, surveys and questionnaires can be used to
collect data on language attitudes, language usage, learning strategies,
and motivations among learners. These instruments can be administered
electronically or in paper form and are designed to gather large amounts of
data from diverse populations quickly.
A survey might be conducted among high school
students to determine the motivations behind choosing
certain foreign languages to study, with questions
focusing on factors like career prospects, cultural
interest, and curriculum offerings.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

149

3.2 Experiments
Experimental research in language studies typically involves
manipulating one or more variables (such as teaching method or learning
environment) to observe the effect on language learning outcomes. This
method is crucial for testing hypotheses about language acquisition and
educational techniques.
An experiment could be conducted where one group
of language learners receives instruction through
traditional classroom methods, while another group
uses a computer-assisted language learning system, to
compare the impacts on language learning rates and
retention through scores.

Example

3.3 Corpus Analysis
Corpus analysis involves the collection and quantitative analysis of
written or spoken texts that represent “real-life” language use. Researchers
use various software tools to analyze large bodies of text, examining
linguistic structures, frequency of words, and patterns that emerge across
different corpora.
A researcher might analyze a corpus of academic
journal articles to study the frequency and use of
passive constructions in academic writing across
different disciplines.

Example

3.4 Language Assessment Tests
Standardized or in-house tests are extensively used to measure
language proficiency in both native and second languages. These tests
provide quantitative data on various aspects of language ability, including
grammar, vocabulary, reading comprehension, and oral proficiency.
The TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) and
IELTS (International English Language Testing System)
are common standardized tests that quantify English
proficiency levels of non-native speakers, aiding in
academic and professional placement.

Example

150

RESEARCH WRITING

3.5 Longitudinal Studies
Longitudinal studies in language studies involve tracking the
development of language skills in individuals or groups over a period of
time. This method is particularly useful for understanding how language
proficiency evolves under different educational interventions.
A longitudinal study could track the English language
development of a cohort of immigrant students in a
bilingual education program over several years to
evaluate the program’s effectiveness.

Example

These quantitative methods provide robust, generalizable data that
can help in making empirical conclusions about language-related
hypotheses. They are invaluable in language education research, where
evidence-based practices are essential for effective teaching and learning
strategies.

4. Qualitative Data Collection
Qualitative data collection methods are flexible approaches
designed to gather rich, descriptive data that provide deeper insights into
human behaviors, experiences, and motivations (Hennink et al., 2020).
These methods are crucial in research for capturing subjective data that can
be analyzed thematically to explore complexities, understand meanings,
and generate theories. In this section, we will examine several key
qualitative data collection methods, emphasizing their application in
research and providing examples from the field of language studies.

4.1 Interviews vs. Focus Group Interviews
4.1.1 Interviews

Interviews in language studies are typically one-on-one sessions
where researchers ask open-ended questions to gain detailed insights into
individual language learning experiences, perceptions, and practices.
A researcher might conduct interviews with non-native
English speakers to explore their challenges and
strategies in acquiring proficiency.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

151

4.1.2 Focus Group Interviews

Focus group interviews involve a group of participants discussing
specific topics guided by a moderator, which allows for interaction and
discussion among the group members. This method can reveal the
dynamics of group opinion and collective experiences.
A focus group might be used to gather data on the
preferences and perceptions of students regarding
different language learning platforms or tools.

Example

4.1.3 Types of Interviews

In qualitative research, interviews are a primary tool for gathering
in-depth information. They can be broadly categorized into three types:
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured. Each type has its specific
methodology and is chosen based on the research objectives. Here is a
detailed look at each type:
4.1.3.1 Structured Interviews

Structured interviews are carefully organized and adhere to a strict
format, with each interviewee receiving the same set of predetermined
questions in the same sequence. This consistency facilitates easy
comparison of responses among different participants. The interviewer
does not deviate from the script, and there is little room for exploring
topics beyond the prepared questions.
In language studies, structured interviews might be
used to assess language learners’ specific preferences
for learning materials and methods. For instance,
researchers might ask a series of yes/no or multiplechoice questions to determine preferences among a
variety of textbook styles or classroom activities.
Example

152

RESEARCH WRITING

4.1.3.2 Semi-Structured Interviews

Semi-structured interviews combine elements of both structured
and unstructured formats. They include a predetermined set of questions,
but interviewers have the flexibility to explore responses further based on
the answers given by the interviewees. This type enables researchers to
explore topics in greater depth while still covering specific areas of interest
consistently across interviews.
A researcher might conduct semi-structured interviews
with language teachers to understand their experiences
and challenges in multilingual classrooms. While there
are guiding questions, the interviewer can follow up
with additional questions based on the responses,

enabling a more in-depth understanding of individual
experiences and insights.

Example
4.1.3.3 Unstructured Interviews

Unstructured interviews are the most flexible type, as they do not
adhere to a predetermined set of questions. Instead, they are guided by a
general framework or theme established by the researcher. This type of
interview is conversational and allows the subject to steer the discussion,
which can lead to unexpected insights and in-depth exploration of complex
topics.
In exploring the nature of language acquisition among
immigrants, an unstructured interview might begin with
a broad question about the individual’s journey with
learning the new language and evolve based on the
topics and themes the participant brings up, such as
personal struggles, informal learning methods, and
cultural experiences.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

Choosing the Right Type of Interviews
The decision to use structured, semi-structured, or unstructured
i ntervi ews typi cal ly d e p e n ds o n t h e s p e c i f i c r e s e arch
objectives :
1. Structured interviews are best when you need quantitativelike data from qualitative research, which allows for
straightforward comparison and statistical analysis.
2. S e mi-structured i n terviews are ideal when you need
comprehensive data but also want to maintain some
direction and focus in the discussions.
3. Unstructured interviews are suited for exploratory studies
where the scope of research might not be fully defined, or
where the researcher is looking for new themes and ideas
to emerge.

4.2 Observations
Observational methods involve observing and recording behaviors
and interactions in natural settings, often without intervention from the
researcher. In language education, this could involve observing classroom
interactions, language use in public spaces, or study habits.
Observing a classroom to see how students interact in
a bilingual education setting, noting both verbal and
non-verbal communication, can provide insights into
the effectiveness of teaching methods and student
engagement.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

4.2.1 Types of Observations

Observational research is a fundamental method in qualitative
studies, allowing researchers to gather data on naturally occurring
behaviors within their real-world context. This method can be broadly
categorized into three types: participant observation, non-participant
observation, and structured observation. Each type serves different research
purposes and has its own advantages and disadvantages. Here is a detailed
look at each:
4.2.1.1 Participant Observation

Participant observation entails the researcher actively engaging in
the daily activities of the subjects being studied. This immersion allows the
researcher to experience the situation from the inside, providing a deep,
nuanced understanding of the social dynamics and behaviors observed.
The researcher may choose to disclose their research intentions to the
group (overt observation) or keep it hidden (covert observation).

In language studies, a researcher might join a
community where a rare dialect is spoken to observe
and participate in daily conversations and cultural
practices. This can help understand not just the
language use but also the cultural contexts in which
the language is embedded.

Example
4.2.1.2 Non-Participant Observation

In non-participant observation, the researcher remains an outsider
who does not become involved in the activities being observed. They
maintain a distance, observing the behavior of study participants without
directly interacting with them. This method minimizes the risk of the
observer’s presence affecting the behavior of the participants.

RESEARCH WRITING

155

A researcher might observe a language classroom
setting to study interactions between language
learners and teachers without participating in the
activities. This method is particularly useful to study
natural behaviors in educational settings without any
influence from the researcher’s participation.

Example

4.2.1.3 Structured Observation

Structured observation is more systematic than participant and nonparticipant observation. It involves observing and recording behavior
according to a consistent protocol and often uses specific instruments like
checklists or coding systems. This method is designed to collect
quantifiable data and is typically used when the research requires specific
behaviors to be measured and compared.
In studying non-verbal communication cues among
speakers of different languages, a researcher could use
a checklist to record specific types of gestures and
expressions during speech. This structured approach
allows for precise, quantifiable comparisons across
different groups.

Example

156

RESEARCH WRITING

Choosing the Right Type of Observations
The choice among these observation types depends on the specific
objectives of the research:
1. Participant observation is most suitable for in-depth,
ethnographic studies where understanding the context and
subtleties of human interactions is crucial.
2. Non-participant observation is effective when the researcher
needs to observe natural behaviors without influencing those
behaviors by their presence.
3. Structured observation works best in studies that require
detailed, systematic data collection on specific behaviors.
Observation methods, particularly in language studies, offer valuable
insights that might not be easily captured through other data collection
methods. They provide an in-depth look at how language is used and
learned in real-world settings, helping to ground research findings in
observable phenomena.

4.3 Introspective Methods
Introspective methods in language studies involve asking
participants to reflect on and report their thoughts and cognitive processes
during language learning or language use. Techniques like think-aloud
protocols are common, where learners narrate their thought process while
engaged in a language task.
A researcher might use think-aloud protocols to
understand how advanced learners of Japanese as a
second language tackle reading comprehension
passages, focusing on the strategies they employ to
understand complex grammar and vocabulary.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

157

4.3.1 Think-Aloud Protocols
Think-aloud protocols require participants to verbalize their
thoughts while performing a language task. This method is employed to
gain insights into the cognitive processes that underpin language use, such
as during reading, writing, or speaking. In this method, participants are
instructed to say whatever comes to their mind as they perform the task
without trying to rationalize or explain their thoughts. The session is
typically recorded, and the data are transcribed and analyzed to identify
patterns in thought processes.
In language education, think-aloud protocols might be
used to understand how language learners process a
text in a second language. For example, learners might
be asked to read a passage and verbalize their
comprehension strategies, difficulties, and inferencing
as they go along. This can help researchers identify
common comprehension barriers and areas where
additional support is needed.

Example

4.3.2 Retrospective Interviews
Retrospective interviews ask participants to reflect on their thought
processes after completing a language task. Unlike think-aloud protocols,
which capture immediate thoughts during the task, retrospective interviews
focus on recollection and reflection, potentially accessing different types of
cognitive information. After completing a task, participants are interviewed
about how they approached the task, what strategies they used, and what
difficulties they encountered. The interview can be guided by specific
questions that aim to uncover detailed cognitive and affective processes.
After a language assessment test, learners might be
interviewed about how they decided on their answers,
what parts of the language test were most challenging,
and how they felt during the testing process. This can
provide insights into test-taking strategies and
emotional responses that affect language performance.
Example

158

RESEARCH WRITING

4.3.3 Diaries and Journals
Diaries and journals are self-report tools that participants use to
regularly document their experiences and reflections over a period of time.
This method can capture changes in attitudes, self-efficacy, and language
use in an ongoing manner. In this method, participants are asked to keep a
regular log or journal of their language learning experiences, noting any
strategies they use, challenges they face, and observations about their own
progress. The journals are then collected and analyzed qualitatively for
themes and patterns.
Language learners might be asked to keep a weekly
diary of their experiences using the target language
o u t s i d e o f t h e c l a s s ro o m . T h i s c o u l d i n c l u d e
interactions at stores, watching movies in the language,
or speaking with native speakers. Analyzing these
diaries can help researchers understand how learners
apply language skills in real-world contexts and how
their confidence evolves.

Example

Introspective methods are highly valued in language studies for
their ability to provide a window into the often-opaque processes of
language thinking and learning. They can reveal the complexities of
cognitive and affective factors influencing language acquisition and
proficiency, making them indispensable tools in both research and
pedagogical assessment.

RESEARCH WRITING

159

4.4 Case Studies
Case studies in language education focus on an in-depth analysis of
a single subject or a small group of subjects, offering a thorough
perspective on specific examples of language learning or educational
phenomena. This method is particularly useful for exploring unique or
exceptional cases that are rich in contextual data.
A case study might focus on a single refugee student’s
journey in learning a new language and adapting to an
educational system in a different country, highlighting
personal experiences, challenges, and the role of
educational support systems.

Example

Each of these qualitative methods offers valuable perspectives that
are often unattainable through quantitative methods alone. They can be
particularly powerful in exploring under-researched or complex issues in
language education, providing a richer, more nuanced understanding of
language learning environments, processes, and outcomes.

5. Language-related Research
In language-related research, especially within the fields of
linguistics, language teaching, and learning, researchers often employ
specialized methods to gather data that can reveal insights into language
comprehension, production, and pragmatic use. Among these methods,
acceptability judgments , picture description tasks , and discourse
completion tests are particularly valuable. Each of these methods provides

unique data that can help researchers understand various aspects of
language acquisition and use.

160

RESEARCH WRITING

5.1 Acceptability Judgments
Acceptability judgment tasks involve participants evaluating the
grammaticality, appropriateness, or naturalness of language items, such as
sentences or phrases (Ionin & Zyzik, 2014). This method helps researchers
understand linguistic competence and intuitions about language structure
and usage. In this method, participants are typically presented with a series
of sentences and asked to rate their acceptability using a Likert scale, or
simply decide whether the sentence is acceptable or not. The tasks can be
presented in written form or orally, depending on the focus of the study.
In language education research, acceptability
judgments might be used to assess learners’
understanding of complex grammatical structures in a
second language. For instance, learners could be
asked to rate sentences using different tenses or
idiomatic expressions to gauge their grasp of these
language elements.

Example

5.2 Picture Description Tasks
Picture description tasks require participants to describe a picture
or series of pictures. This method is used to elicit natural language
production (Latash & Mikaelian, 2010), providing data on how language is
used spontaneously and which linguistic structures are utilized. In this
method, participants are shown images and asked to describe what they
see in as much detail as possible. The descriptions can be done verbally or
in written form. Researchers analyze the content for aspects like vocabulary
usage, syntactic structures, fluency, and accuracy.
In a study on language acquisition, learners of English
might be shown a complex scene (like a busy city
street) and asked to describe everything happening in
the picture. This can reveal their ability to use
descriptive language, handle multiple actions in
narrative form, and employ appropriate prepositions
and adjectives.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

161

5.3 Discourse Completion Tests
Discourse completion tests (DCTs) are used to study pragmatic
aspects of language use, such as politeness, formality, and the use of
indirect language (Roever, 2011). Participants are given scenarios that
require a response, and their answers provide insight into how they handle
various communicative situations. In this method, DCTs usually present a
scenario or a series of scenarios to participants, asking them to write or say
what they would typically respond in that situation. Scenarios are designed
to elicit specific types of language interaction, such as requests, apologies,
or compliments.
To examine politeness strategies among learners of
Japanese, participants could be given a scenario where
they must refuse an invitation from a superior. The test
would reveal how learners use language to navigate
socially sensitive interactions, including the use of
honorifics and polite declinations.

Example

These methods are highly effective in revealing the nuances of
language use and acquisition. They allow researchers to quantitatively and
qualitatively analyze language competencies and pragmatic skills in real-life
or simulated situations, making them invaluable in both theoretical
linguistics and applied language teaching and learning contexts.

Writing to Describe Data Collection
Writing about data collection in research papers involves detailing
how, when, and where data were gathered. This section ensures readers
understand the methodology and can evaluate the reliability and
applicability of the research findings. It often forms part of the “Methods”
section (see Ch. 4) and should be precise and clear to enable replication.

162

RESEARCH WRITING

Key Components to Include
1. Instrumentation : Detail the tools and instruments used for
data collection (e.g., surveys, interviews, observation
checklists).
2. Procedure : Outline the step-by-step process used for
collecting data, including any instructions provided to
participants.
3. Data Handling: Mention how the data were recorded and
stored to ensure confidentiality and integrity.

Language Tips
1. Use the past tense to describe actions that have been
completed.
2. Employ passive voice to focus on the action rather than the
researcher.
3. Ensure clarity by avoiding jargons and clearly defining any
technical terms.

RESEARCH WRITING

Activity 5.3: Writing an Instrumentation

Directions: Describe the data collection instruments and procedures used.

Then explain how data confidentiality was maintained.
Context : Imagine you are researching the effectiveness of different

language learning strategies among high school students.
Sample Data Collection Description:
Part A: Instruments and Procedures
Data were collected through a combination of structured surveys and semistructured interviews. The survey, comprising 20 multiple-choice questions,
assessed the frequency and type of strategies used by students. Interviews,
lasting approximately 30 minutes, sought to gain deeper insights into students’
perceptions of these strategies. Both instruments were pilot-tested to ensure
reliability and validity.

Part B: Data Handling
Confidentiality was ensured by anonymizing all survey and interview responses
with codes. Data were stored securely in encrypted files accessible only to the
research team. Participants were informed that their responses would be used
solely for academic purposes and that any publications would not include
identifiable information.

Ethical Considerations during Data Collection
Ethical considerations are critical in the conduct of research,
particularly during the data collection phase. Adhering to ethical standards
not only maintains the integrity of the research process but also safeguards
the rights and well-being of participants. Below are important ethical
considerations to keep in mind during data collection:
Informed Consent
•Participants must be thoroughly informed about the study’s nature, including what
it entails, any potential risks, and their rights throughout the research process. They
should be made aware that their participation is voluntary and that they can
withdraw at any time without facing any penalties. Written consent should be
obtained to document that participants have agreed to participate after receiving
all the necessary information.

Confidentiality and Anonymity
•Researchers must protect the privacy of participants by handling personal
information confidentially. This means data should be anonymized or de-identified
where possible, ensuring that individual responses cannot be traced back to
specific individuals. Storing data securely and limiting access to the research team
are also crucial steps.

Minimization of Harm
•Researchers should aim to minimize any potential harm or discomfort to
participants. This involves assessing risks associated with the study and taking
proactive measures to mitigate them. If the research involves sensitive topics,
ensure that support mechanisms (like counseling referrals) are in place for
participants who may need them.

Respect for Vulnerable Populations
•Extra care should be taken when the research involves vulnerable groups such as
children, elderly people, or individuals with disabilities. This may involve obtaining
consent from guardians or caretakers, and ensuring that the research procedures
are adapted to meet the specific needs of these groups without compromising their
dignity or autonomy.

Avoidance of Deception
•Deception in research, where participants are misled about the study’s aims or
procedures, should be avoided unless absolutely necessary (e.g., where knowing
the true nature of the study might alter participants’ behavior and invalidate the
results). Even then, deception must be justified, minimized, and participants must
be fully debriefed post-study.

Right to Withdraw
•Participants should be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any
point without any form of disadvantage. This right should be respected throughout
the research process, and procedures for withdrawal should be straightforward
and clear

Summary
This chapter is pivotal in understanding how researchers gather
information necessary to support or refute hypotheses within the broader
framework of academic inquiry, particularly in the areas of language studies.
This section highlights the critical importance of choosing the appropriate
sampling method—be it probability or non-probability sampling—based
on the research objectives, availability of participants, and the nature of the
study. Probability sampling methods, including simple random, systematic,
and stratified random sampling, are essential for quantitative studies where
the goal is to generalize findings to a broader population. Conversely, nonprobability sampling methods such as convenience, quota, judgment, and
snowball sampling are more suited to qualitative research, where depth
rather than breadth is required. These approaches to data collection ensure
that the data gathered are robust and representative of the population
studied, thus lending credibility to the research outcomes.
Moreover, understanding different types of data—nominal, ordinal,
interval, and ratio—and their appropriate uses within the context of
language education enhances the precision of data analysis and
interpretation. Each type of data provides unique insights and requires
specific statistical approaches to draw meaningful conclusions. By detailing
the methodology used in data collection, researchers enable the replication
of their study, thereby reinforcing the reliability and veracity of their
findings.

Reﬂection Questions
1. Why is it important to clearly define the population and sampling
method in the data collection section of a research paper?
2. How might the choice between probability and non-probability
sampling methods impact the interpretation of data in language
studies research?
3. Discuss the potential challenges and ethical considerations
involved in collecting data from diverse populations in language
studies.

Research Qualities
“Ensuring research quality is like baking a soufflé – one wrong move,
and the whole thing collapses! So follow the recipe (aka research methodology) closely,
and don’t forget to preheat your oven (peer review) for that perfect rise.”

Conducting high-quality research is crucial for producing reliable
and valid findings that contribute to the advancement of knowledge in any
field. Researchers must thoughtfully consider different elements of their
research design, including the variables being examined, the methods
used to measure these variables, and the strategies implemented to ensure
the validity and reliability of their results. This chapter will examine these
fundamental aspects of research quality, which provides you with the
knowledge and skills required to generate rigorous and reliable research
results.

1. Research Variables
Variables are the fundamental building blocks of any research study.
They represent the characteristics or factors under investigation and can be
categorized as independent variables (the variables that the researcher
manipulates or controls) or dependent variables (the variables that are
measured or observed to evaluate the effects of the independent variables)
as depicted in Fig. 6.1 below.
Mediator

Figure 6.1 Variables in research

170

RESEARCH WRITING

From Fig. 6.1, you can think of a mediator as a link between two
variables. For instance, attention (an independent variable) may influence
academic achievement (a dependent variable) through the mediator of
alertness. In a mediation relationship, you can illustrate this by drawing an

arrow from the independent variable to the mediator, and then another
arrow from the mediator to the dependent variable. A mediator explains
how an independent variable affects a dependent variable and is a
component of the causal pathway of that effect, revealing how or why the
effect occurs.

If something is a mediator:
1. It is influenced by the independent variable.
2. It affects the dependent variable.
In contrast, a moderator is a factor that influences the relationship
between two variables, altering either its direction or strength. For example,
well-being may moderate the relationship between quality of life and
academic achievement; this relationship might be stronger for individuals
with diagnosed well-being compared to those without it.
Identifying and defining the relevant variables for your research is a
critical first step. Clearly operationalizing these variables ensures that they
are measurable and that their measurements are consistent across different
contexts and researchers.

RESEARCH WRITING

171

Activity 6.1: What am I?

Directions: Read the aforementioned scenario, and put the given factors in

the box to make a correct relationships between variables.
Scenario

In a study on language learning and language achievement, you
hypothesize that:
•

More hours of language learning predict language achievement, when
controlling for relevant variables,

•

Age moderates the relationship between language learning and
language achievement.

This means that the relationship between hours of language learning and
language achievement would differ between kids, teenagers, and adults.

1.1 Operationalizing Variables
Operationalizing a variable involves defining it in concrete,
observable terms. This process typically involves breaking down abstract
concepts into specific, measurable components. For example, if you are
studying “job satisfaction,” you might operationalize it by measuring
factors such as work-life balance, opportunities for advancement,
compensation, and workplace environment. In other words, how is this
variable specifically defined and measured in the context of your study?

172

RESEARCH WRITING

1.2 Measuring Variables
Once you have identified and operationalized your research
variables, the next step is to select appropriate methods for measuring
them, namely quantitative measures and qualitative measures. The choice
of measurement instruments or techniques depends on the nature of the
variables under investigation and the research design.

1.2.1 Quantitative Measures

Quantitative measures involve assigning numerical values to
variables, allowing for statistical analysis and comparisons. Examples of
quantitative measures include surveys, tests, or observational coding
schemes that produce numerical data.

1.2.2 Qualitative Measures

Qualitative measures, on the other hand, involve collecting and
analyzing non-numerical data, such as text, images, or audio/video
recordings. Examples of qualitative measures include interviews, focus
groups, ethnographic observations, and document analysis.

Regardless of the type of measure used, it is crucial to ensure that
the measurement instruments or techniques are valid and reliable. Thus, in
the following section, validity and reliability will be discussed respectively.

2. Validity
Validity refers to the degree to which a measurement instrument or
technique accurately assesses what it is supposed to measure. There are
several types of validity to take into account:
o

Content validity: This refers to the extent to which the measurement

instrument thoroughly covers the entire range of the construct
being assessed.

RESEARCH WRITING

o

173

Construct validity : This pertains to how well the measurement

instrument accurately represents the theoretical construct it aims to
measure.
o

C r i t e r i o n v a l i d i t y : This indicates the degree to which the

measurement instrument correlates with a recognized external
criterion or benchmark.
Strategies for improving validity include e x p e r t re v i e w o f
measurement instruments , pilot testing , and using multiple sources of
data (triangulation).

2.1 Expert Review of Measurement Instruments
Expert review involves having subject matter experts or experienced
researchers examine the measurement instruments (e.g., surveys, tests,
interview protocols) to assess their content validity. This process helps to
ensure that the items or questions within the instruments sufficiently
represent the complete range of the construct being measured.
When developing a survey to measure students’
attitudes toward learning a second language, the
researcher would have the survey reviewed by a panel
of language education experts. The experts would
evaluate whether the survey items cover the key
dimensions of language learning attitudes, such as
motivation, anxiety, self-confidence, and perceived
value of the language. Their feedback would help the
researcher refine the survey and ensure that it
comprehensively captures the construct of language
learning attitudes.

Example

174

RESEARCH WRITING

2.2 Pilot Testing
Pilot testing entails administering the measurement instruments or
research procedures to a small group of participants who represent the
target population. This process enables researchers to identify and resolve
any issues or ambiguities in the instruments or procedures prior to
conducting the full-scale study.
When developing a proficiency test for English language
learners, the researcher would first pilot the test with a small
group of learners representing different proficiency levels. The
pilot testing would help the researcher identify any test items
that are unclear or too difficult/easy, as well as gather feedback
on the test instructions and administration procedures. Based
on the pilot results, the researcher could then refine the test
items and make necessary adjustments to improve the overall
validity of the instrument.

Example

2.3 Using Multiple Sources of Data (Triangulation)
Triangulation involves gathering data from various sources or
employing multiple methods to verify the findings. This approach enhances
the validity of the research by offering a more comprehensive and nuanced
understanding of the phenomenon being studied.
A researcher studying the effectiveness of a new language
learning app might use a combination of data sources, such as:
• Pre- and post-tests to measure students’ language proficiency
gains
• Classroom observations to assess student engagement and
language use
• Student interviews to understand their perceptions and
experiences with the app
• Log data from the app to analyze patterns of usage and
interaction
By triangulating these multiple sources of data, the researcher can
gain a more holistic and valid understanding of the app’s impact
on student learning and language development.

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

175

The triangulation of these various data sources would provide a
more comprehensive and valid assessment of the complex relationship
between language and cultural identity.

3. Reliability
Reliability refers to the consistency and reproducibility of
measurements. A reliable measurement instrument or technique should
produce similar results when administered under similar conditions. There
are different types of reliability to consider:
o Internal consistency reliability : The extent to which the items or
components of a measurement instrument are consistent with each
other and measure the same underlying construct.
o Test-retest reliability : The degree to which the same measurement
instrument produces consistent results when administered to the
same individuals at different points in time.
o Inter-rater reliability: The extent to which different raters or observers
produce consistent scores or ratings when evaluating the same
phenomenon.
Strategies for improving reliability include s t a n d a rd i z i n g
measurement procedures , training raters or observers , and conducting
pilot tests to identify and address potential sources of measurement error.

3.1 Standardizing Measurement Procedures
This strategy involves establishing consistent guidelines and
protocols for conducting assessments or gathering data. Standardization

ensures that all measurements are taken in the same manner.
In a language education context, standardized measurement
procedures could involve using the same rubric for grading
speaking assignments across different classes or instructors.
This ensures that all students are evaluated based on the same
criteria, minimizing subjective biases.

Example

176

RESEARCH WRITING

3.2 Training Raters or Observers
Training raters or observers involves providing instruction and
practice to individuals responsible for assessing language proficiency or
behavior. This training helps ensure that raters are consistent and reliable
in their judgments.
In a language studies research project where observers are
assessing language fluency in a group of bilingual participants,
researchers could conduct training sessions where observers
practice rating language samples and receive feedback. This
helps calibrate their judgments and ensures consistency in
rating across different observers.

Example

3.3 Conducting Pilot Tests
Pilot tests involve administering assessments or conducting research
trials on a small scale before full implementation. This allows researchers to
identify and address potential sources of measurement error or logistical
issues before conducting the main study.
Before launching a large-scale study on the effectiveness of a
new language teaching method, researchers could conduct a
pilot test with a small group of students. This pilot test helps
identify any challenges in implementing the method, such as
unclear instructions or technical issues with materials, allowing
researchers to refine their procedures before proceeding with
the main study.

Example

4. Minimizing Bias
In addition to issues of validity and reliability, bias in research is
another concern. Bias can stem from various sources, such as the
researcher’s personal beliefs, assumptions, or expectations, as well as the
characteristics of the study participants or the research context. Bias can
threaten the validity and reliability of research findings, making it essential

RESEARCH WRITING

177

to implement measures to minimize its impact. Before we are able to
minimize bias, it is important to find the ‘sources’ of bias.

4.1 Sources of Bias
Common sources of bias in research include:
4.1.1 Selection bias

Systematic differences between the characteristics of individuals
included in the study and those excluded, which can lead to biased or
unrepresentative samples. This bias occurs when there are systematic
differences between the characteristics of individuals included in the study
and those excluded, leading to unrepresentative samples.
In a study evaluating the effectiveness of a new language
learning program, if only highly motivated students volunteer to
participate, the sample may not accurately represent the
broader student population. This could lead to an
overestimation of the program’s effectiveness since highly
motivated students might perform better regardless of the
program.

Example
4.1.2 Measurement bias

Measurement bias refers to inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the
measurement instruments or techniques employed, which lead to
systematic errors in data collection.
If a language proficiency test is biased towards certain dialects
or cultural contexts, it may not accurately measure the language
skills of all participants. For instance, a test designed primarily
for American English speakers might underestimate the
proficiency of non-native speakers from different linguistic
backgrounds.

Example

178

RESEARCH WRITING

4.1.3 Researcher bias

Researcher bias occurs when the personal beliefs, assumptions, or
expectations of the researcher impact different stages of the research
process, including data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
A researcher who strongly believes in the superiority of
immersive language learning approaches might unintentionally
design a study in a way that favors immersive methods over
other approaches. This bias could manifest in the selection of
assessment measures, interpretation of results, or emphasis on
certain findings over others.

Example

4.1.4 Participant bias

The influence of participants’ characteristics, behaviors, or
expectations on their responses or the data collected. Participant bias
refers to the influence of participants’ characteristics, behaviors, or
expectations on their responses or the data collected.
In a study investigating language attitudes, participants might
provide socially desirable responses rather than expressing their
true opinions, especially if they perceive certain language
varieties or accents as stigmatized. This could lead to biased
data if participants alter their responses to align with societal
norms or expectations.

Example

By being aware of these biases and taking steps to mitigate them,
researchers can enhance the validity and reliability of their findings. This
may include using validated measurement instruments, maintaining
objectivity throughout the research process, and implementing strategies
to minimize participant bias, such as ensuring confidentiality and anonymity.

RESEARCH WRITING

179

4.2 Strategies for Minimizing Bias
To minimize the impact of bias on research outcomes, researchers
can employ various strategies, such as:
4.2.1 Random sampling

Random sampling techniques are used to ensure that the study
sample accurately represents the population of interest. This method
involves selecting participants in such a way that each individual has an
equal chance of being chosen. By doing so, random sampling helps to
minimize the risk of selection bias and enhances the representativeness of
the study sample.
In a study examining the language proficiency of high school
students in a certain region, researchers could use a random
sampling technique to select schools from a list of all high
schools in that region. Then, within each selected school, they
could randomly select classes or students to participate in the
study, ensuring a representative sample.

Example

4.2.2 Double-blind procedures

Concealing the identities or conditions of participants from both
the researchers and the participants themselves, where possible. Doubleblind procedures involve concealing the identities or conditions of
participants from both the researchers and the participants themselves,
where possible. This helps minimize the potential for researcher bias and
participant bias.
In a language acquisition study where participants are receiving
different types of language instruction, researchers could use a
double-blind procedure by not disclosing to either the
instructors or the students which instructional method is being
tested. This prevents the instructors’ and students’ expectations
or biases from influencing the results.

Example

180

RESEARCH WRITING

4.2.3 Standardized protocols

Developing and adhering to standardized protocols for data
collection, measurement, and analysis to ensure consistency and minimize
potential sources of error. Standardized protocols entail developing and
adhering to consistent procedures for data collection, measurement, and
analysis. This helps ensure reliability and minimizes potential sources of
error or measurement bias.
In a study assessing language fluency, researchers could use
standardized language proficiency tests that have been
validated for reliability and validity. They could also establish
clear guidelines for administering the tests, scoring responses,
and interpreting results to ensure consistency across different
test administrators and testing sessions.

Example

4.2.4 Triangulation

Triangulation involves employing multiple sources of data,
methods, or researchers to cross-validate findings and diminish the
influence of any single source of bias. This approach enhances the
credibility and reliability of the research outcomes.
In a study investigating language attitudes, researchers could
collect data through surveys, interviews, and observations to
gain multiple perspectives on participants’ attitudes towards
different language varieties. By triangulating data from various
sources, researchers can validate their findings and offer a more
comprehensive understanding of language attitudes.

Example

4.2.5 Reﬂexivity

Actively reflecting on and acknowledging the researcher’s personal
biases, assumptions, and positionality, and taking steps to mitigate their
influence on the research process. Reflexivity involves actively reflecting on
and acknowledging the researcher’s personal biases, assumptions, and
positionality, and taking steps to mitigate their influence on the research
process.

RESEARCH WRITING

181

In a qualitative study exploring language ideologies, researchers
could maintain reflexivity by regularly journaling about their
own thoughts, biases, and reactions during data collection and
analysis. They could also engage in peer debriefing or member
checking to validate interpretations and ensure that their own
biases are not unduly shaping the research findings.

Example

When implementing these strategies, researchers can enhance the
quality, validity, and reliability of their research findings, contributing to a
more robust and trustworthy body of knowledge.

Data Analysis
“Data analysis is like trying to assemble IKEA furniture without the instructions you might have all the pieces, but it’s going to take some trial and error
before you figure out what goes where.”

The process of data analysis is integral to research, enabling
researchers to derive meaningful insights from collected data. In this
chapter, we will explore both quantitative and qualitative data analysis
techniques, equipping you with the skills necessary to analyze and interpret
research findings effectively. From descriptive statistics to thematic analysis,
you will learn how to apply appropriate data analysis methods and utilize
software tools to enhance the rigor and validity of their research.

1. Quantitative analysis
Quantitative analysis focuses on the examination of numerical data
to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This section addresses
important statistical concepts, including descriptive statistics, correlation,
and inferential statistics.

1.1 Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics provide a summary and description of the
characteristics of a dataset. This includes measures of frequency, central
tendency (e.g., mean, median, and mode), and dispersion (e.g., range,
variance, and standard deviation). In this section, you will learn how to
calculate and interpret these statistics to better understand the distribution
and variability of your data.

1.1.1 Measures of Frequency

Measures of Frequency help us understand how often something
happens , like a specific behavior or event. For example, in language

studies, we might count how many times learners make mistakes when

188

RESEARCH WRITING

using past tense verbs or how many of students participating in the study.
We often organize these counts into tables, like the one you might see in a
research paper. Table 7.1 shows us the numbers in a clear way.

2020)

Sometimes, instead of tables, we use graphs to show frequencies.
Graphs, like bar graphs or line graphs, make it easier to see patterns. For
instance, if we had data on errors made by language learners, we could use
a bar graph or line graph to illustrate how often each type of error occurs.

While frequency measures may not always directly align with
specific research questions, they are crucial tools for summarizing and

RESEARCH WRITING

189

analyzing data. These measures offer a clear overview of the fundamental
characteristics of the data, which could assist researchers in choosing
appropriate statistical analyses. Therefore, despite their apparent lack of
direct relevance to certain research inquiries, frequency measures play a
vital role in the overall research process.

1.1.2 Measures of Central Tendency

While tallying how often something occurs gives us a starting point
for understanding our data, it may not always give us the most accurate
picture, especially when comparing different groups. In language studies,
researchers often turn to measures of central tendency to get a clearer idea
of what is typical for learners. There are three main measures we use for
this, including mode, median, and mean.

1.1.2.1 Mode

The mode is perhaps the simplest measure to identify. It is just the
most common score in a group of data. For instance, if we have EFL test
scores like 15, 13, 14, 17 , 17 , 18, 12 and 20, the mode would be 17
because it appears twice. However, the mode can be affected by random
scores, especially if there are only a few participants. That is why it is not
widely used in second language research.

15 13 14 17 17 18 12 20

1.1.2.2 Median

Another straightforward measure is the median. It is the score right
in the middle when all the scores are arranged in order. For example, if we
sort the scores from low to high (12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 17, 18, and 20), the
median would be the score in the middle, which here would be 16. In this
case, there are two middle values. We have to plus them and divide the
total with two [(15+17) ÷ 2 = 16]. We often use the median when there are
extreme scores, called outliers, in the data.

1.1.2.3 Mean

The most commonly used measure is the mean, or the average
score . It is the total of all the scores divided by how many there are. For

instance, with the same set of scores, if we add up all the scores and divide
by 8 (the number of scores), we get the mean, which here is 15.75. The
mean is often reported in research because it helps us understand group
behavior better. However, it can be influenced by extreme scores, especially
in small groups. We can show means visually using graphs, like bar graphs
or line graphs, which give a quick summary of the data’s central tendency.

1.1.3 Measures of Dispersion

While measures of central tendency give us a sense of what is
typical for a group, they might not tell the whole story. Consider two groups
of students’ exam scores: one group with scores of 58, 62, 65, 64, 63, and
60, and another with scores of 45, 89, 63, 17, 63, and 94. Both groups have
similar means (62 and 61.8, respectively), but they differ in how spread out
their scores are. One way to show this is through the range, which is the
gap between the highest and lowest scores (the first one: 65-58 = 7; the
second one: 94-17 = 77). However, ranges can be unreliable due to
extreme scores.
A more common method to measure variability is the standard
deviation (SD), which shows how scores are dispersed around the mean. To
calculate it:
1. Find the mean (∑x ÷ n = 62).
2. Subtract each score from the mean, square the differences (Table
6.2).
3. Sum them up, divide by the number of scores. This is the variance.
4. Finally, take the square root of the variance. For example, the
standard deviation for the first group’s scores is 2.380, while for the
second group, it is 25.95.

A larger standard deviation means more variability, indicating less

uniformity in behavior. In research, it is essential to report both the mean
and standard deviation to give a complete picture of the data. Sometimes,
visual representations, like graphs, can also help in understanding
variability.

The standard deviation quantifies the variability or dispersion of
data points around the mean within each teaching level category. A lower
standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely clustered
around the mean, suggesting less variability in the reported levels of crisis
of meaning at work. In contrast, a higher standard deviation indicates that
the data points are more widely spread from the mean, reflecting greater
variability in the reported crisis of meaning at work within each teaching
level category. From Table 6.3, in the Lower secondary teaching level, the
standard deviation is reported to be approximately 0.769, suggesting less
variability compared to the Upper secondary teaching level, where the
standard deviation is approximately 0.884, indicating greater variability in
reported crisis of meaning at work.

1.2 Correlation
Correlation analysis is a statistical technique used to examine the
relationship between two or more variables in research. It helps researchers
determine both the strength and direction of the relationship among these
variables. Overall, correlation analysis provides important insights into the
connections between different variables in language studies and language
education research, helping researchers make informed interpretations and
decisions based on their findings (see Table 7.4 and Fig. 7.2).
Correlation analysis can be used to investigate the relationship
between vocabulary size and reading comprehension.
Researchers may gather data on participants’ vocabulary
knowledge alongside their reading comprehension scores. By
calculating a correlation coefficient, like Pearson’s r, they can
assess the strength and direction of the relationship between
these two variables. A positive and significant correlation
coefficient indicates that an increase in vocabulary size is
associated with improved reading comprehension. On the other
hand, a negative correlation would suggest that as one variable
increases, the other decreases.

Example

194

RESEARCH WRITING

Figure 7.2 Different levels of correlation coefficients

F Important Note
“Correlation does not imply causation.”
From the above statement, this means that even if two variables are
correlated, it does not imply that one variable causes changes in the other.
Let’s break it down with examples relevant to language research.
Imagine a study where a researcher finds a positive correlation
between vocabulary size and reading comprehension scores
among language learners. This correlation suggests that as
learners’ vocabulary size increases, their reading comprehension
tends to improve. However, this does not mean that having a
larger vocabulary directly causes better reading comprehension.
Other factors could be at play, such as exposure to reading
materials, comprehension strategies, or prior knowledge. It’s
possible that learners with stronger reading comprehension
skills naturally acquire more vocabulary through extensive
reading, rather than the other way around.

Example

In this example, while there is a relationship between the variables,
remember that correlation alone cannot establish causation. Additional
research, such as experimental studies or longitudinal analyses, would be
needed to determine causality. Understanding this principle helps

RESEARCH WRITING

195

researchers interpret their findings more accurately and avoid making
unwarranted conclusions about cause and effect based solely on
correlation.

1.3 Inferential Statistics
Certain types of research in second language studies aim to extend
beyond merely understanding how a specific group of students, such as
those studying first-year Spanish, grasp certain aspects of the language.
Instead, the objective is to draw broader conclusions beyond the immediate
findings. Researchers seek to infer from the data collected from a particular
sample to the larger population. Since it might be impractical to collect
data from every individual within the population, inferential statistics allow
researchers to make inferences or generalizations about a population based
on sample data. This section introduces students to common inferential
techniques, including hypothesis testing, t-tests, ANOVA, and regression
analysis (see Table 6.5). It is worth noting that for undergraduate studies,
the use of such inferential statistics may be considered optional.

1.3.1 T-Tests

A t-test is a statistical method used to compare the means of two
groups to assess whether they are significantly different from one another.
It is commonly applied when the data is continuous, normally distributed,
and when comparing the means of two groups.
•

Independent Samples T-Test: Comparing the average

scores of two different groups of students (e.g., those who
received a new teaching method vs. those who did not).
•

Paired Samples T-Test: Comparing the same group of

students’ test scores before and after using a new learning
tool.
Example

196

RESEARCH WRITING

How to Interpret:
•

If the p-value is less than the significance level (usually set at 0.05), it
indicates a statistically significant difference between the means of
the two groups.

•

If the p-value exceeds 0.05, it suggests that there is no statistically
significant difference, meaning that any observed difference may be
attributed to random chance.

1.3.2 ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)

ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, is a statistical test used to compare
the means of three or more groups. It helps to determine whether at least
one group mean is significantly different from the others. ANOVA is useful
when dealing with more than two groups and you want to know if there are
any overall differences.
•

One-Way ANOVA: Comparing the average test scores

of students across three different teaching methods.
•

Two-Way ANOVA: Examining the effects of two

different variables (e.g., teaching method and gender)
on student performance.
Example

How to Interpret:
•

If the p-value from ANOVA is less than 0.05, at least one group mean
is significantly different from the others. You would then conduct a
post-hoc test (like Tukey’s HSD) to find out which specific groups
differ.

•

If the p-value is greater than 0.05, there is no significant difference
between any of the group means.

RESEARCH WRITING

197

1.3.3 Regression Analysis

Regression analysis is a technique used to explore the relationship
between one dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
It aids in predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values
of the independent variables.
•

Simple Linear Regression: Predicting students’ final

exam scores based on the number of hours they
studied.
•

Multiple Regression: Predicting students’ final exam

scores based on several factors, such as hours studied,
attendance, and prior grades.
Example

•

How to Interpret:
•

Look at the coefficient of the independent variable(s) to see the
nature and strength of the relationship (positive or negative).

•

The p-value associated with each coefficient tells you if the
relationship is statistically significant. A p-value less than 0.05
suggests a significant relationship.

•

R2 value indicates how much of the variation in the dependent

variable is explained by the independent variables. An R2 close to 1
suggests a strong explanatory power, while an R2 closer to 0
suggests a weak explanatory power.

Summary
Understanding these tests helps you analyze data effectively:
•

T-tests tell if two groups differ.

•

ANOVA tells if more than two groups differ.

Regression explains and predicts relationships between variables.

2. Qualitative analysis
Qualitative analysis involves the interpretation of non-numerical
data to uncover themes, patterns, and meanings. This section explores two
prominent qualitative analysis techniques: coding and content analysis vs
thematic analysis.

2.1 Coding
Coding involves the systematic categorization and labeling of
qualitative data to identify recurring themes or patterns. You will learn how
to develop coding schemes, apply codes to data sources (e.g., interviews,
focus groups), and organize coded data for analysis.
After collecting data, it becomes essential to structure it in a way
that is easy to manage, comprehend, and analyze. This section explores
several methods for achieving this objective, which offers an overview of
the steps involved in data organization:
1. Transcribing and preparing raw data for organization.
2. Adjusting or creating suitable coding systems tailored to the

data type and research objectives.
3. Addressing reliability issues in coding.
4. Executing the coding process.
5. Providing examples of common models and customized

coding systems.
6. Addressing considerations relevant to both quantitative and

qualitative research.
7. Exploring decision-making processes concerning the extent

and specifics of coding.
Transcribing oral data is a frequent task in second language
research. Such data can originate from various sources, such as interviews
with native speakers and learners, communicative tasks conducted by
learners in pairs, or classroom interactions between learners and teachers.

200

RESEARCH WRITING

Step 1: Transcription Process

Transcription methods vary based on research objectives. Not every
utterance from each participant needs transcription; sometimes, only
specific features relevant to the study are transcribed. Alternatively,
researchers may opt to mark features as present or absent on a coding
sheet after listening to the data. However, notable examples and exceptions
are usually transcribed for later reference. In some cases, researchers
transcribe everything in detail (see Fig. 7.3 below). Below is an example of
transcription conventions.

Figure 7.3 Example of transcript conventions (Gass & Houck, 1999, p. 209).

RESEARCH WRITING

201

Transcription conventions are employed to represent oral data in
written form, aiding both coding and the presentation of examples in
research reports. While there are no universally agreed-upon conventions,
certain symbols, like using dots to denote pauses or silence, are commonly
recognized.

Step 2: Coding Qualitative Data

Similar to quantitative research, qualitative researchers may engage
in coding to identify patterns within the data. However, in qualitative
research, coding typically arises from the data itself rather than being
predetermined before data collection. This approach, known as “open
coding,” involves deriving initial categories directly from the data during
the initial analysis phase. Qualitative researchers explore these emerging
categories, examining potential connections among them and considering
variations within each category. This iterative process guides the adaptation
and refinement of the coding system to accurately reflect the data.
A code is a name or label assigned by the researcher to a segment
of text that conveys an idea or piece of information. Texts can be coded
lightly or densely, and codes can vary in their level of specificity and
generality when defining content and concepts. Some codes may
encompass others, creating a hierarchical structure of subsumption, which
results in a tree diagram of codes. Analyzing content (such as interview
transcripts) involves making inferences by systematically and objectively
identifying specific characteristics of the messages. In other words, the
process of analyzing texts includes: 1) breaking down texts into units of
analysis, 2) coding à categorizing à identifying themes (Fig. 7.4), and 3)
presenting the analysis in prose.

202

RESEARCH WRITING

Figure 7.4 Coding process

For instance, one method of coding qualitative data involves
identifying emergent patterns and themes relevant to the research
question. Researchers assign paraphrases, questions, headings, or labels to
segments of the data, allowing themes to emerge organically. The coding
process is data-driven rather than driven by existing theories or frameworks.
Researchers keep track of the origins of their insights and may incorporate
interesting data beyond the study’s scope into their analysis. As themes
and categories begin to take shape, researchers develop a conceptual
schema or organizational system that contributes to the field’s
understanding.

Notes
1. Data analysis should occur SOON after the researcher starts

collecting data. There is no need to wait until all data is
collected. – This enables the emergent design.
2. Consider various types of coding to come up with relevant codes.
3. Code data according to what the researcher is looking for. Then

group codes into themes. Label these themes. Group themes into
categories. Always go back to research questions as coding
norms.
4. Think of how to present codes/themes/categories in your report.

them?

Activity 7.2: Coding Practice

Directions: Code the following extract of an interview script.
Interviewer: What language skills - reading, writing, listening, and speaking

- do you think are most important for science students to practice for their
future careers?

different science fields, their needs could vary. ((laugh))
HOWEVER, I believe all four skills are valuable. Speaking
is often a good place to start, as it builds confidence with
using the language. Writing can be quite challenging,
especially at lower proficiency levels. A lot of their writing
assignments contain many errors, and being too critical
could discourage them. So for writing, I try to focus on
specific areas rather than comprehensively correcting
everything. Reading and listening are also crucial for
developing overall English ability. Ultimately, while all
skills are important, some are more difficult than others
based on their current English level and motivation to
learn the language. The key is providing opportunities to
practice each skill in a supportive environment.

2.2 Content Analysis vs. Thematic Analysis
Content analysis and thematic analysis are two approaches to
analyzing qualitative data, each with its own strengths and applications.
Students will learn the differences between these approaches and when to
use them in their research projects. Content analysis focuses on the
objective analysis of textual or visual data, while thematic analysis
emphasizes the identification and interpretation of underlying themes or
concepts.
Content analysis and thematic analysis are both popular methods
for analyzing qualitative data, but they differ in their focus, process, and
purpose.

2.2.1 Content Analysis:

•

Focus : Content analysis focuses on the objective examination of

textual or visual data to identify patterns, themes, or trends.
•

Purpose: It aims to analyze data qualitatively and at the same time

quantify and categorize data systematically, often to draw statistical
inferences or make generalizations about a population.
•

Process:

o

C o d i n g : Researchers develop a coding scheme to

categorize different elements of the data.
o

Data Reduction: Data is condensed into manageable units

based on the coding scheme.
o

Analysis: Quantitative techniques are often used to analyze

frequencies or patterns within the data.
•

Applications: Content analysis is frequently employed in fields such

as media studies, marketing research, and communication studies
to effectively analyze large amounts of textual or visual data.

RESEARCH WRITING

205

2.2.2 Thematic Analysis:

•

Focus : Thematic analysis emphasizes the identification and

interpretation of underlying themes or concepts within the data.
•

Purpose : It aims to explore the meanings and patterns inherent in

the data, providing insights into the experiences and perspectives
of participants.
•

Process:

o

Familiarization : Researchers immerse themselves in the

data to become familiar with its content.
o

Coding : Initial codes are generated to capture interesting

features of the data.
o

Theme Development: Codes are grouped into themes that

represent patterns or concepts within the data.
o

Review and Refinement: Themes are reviewed and refined

to ensure they accurately capture the essence of the data.
o

Analysis : Interpretations are made based on the identified

themes, often supported by quotes or examples from the
data.
•

Applications : Thematic analysis is widely used in social sciences,

psychology, and qualitative research across various disciplines to
gain a deeper understanding of phenomena and experiences.

Summary
In this chapter, you will gain essential skills to derive meaningful
insights from both quantitative and qualitative data. The chapter covers a
range of techniques, starting with quantitative analysis, which involves
examining numerical data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
You have learned about descriptive statistics, including measures of
frequency, central tendency, and dispersion, enabling them to summarize
and interpret the characteristics of their data effectively. The chapter also
explores correlation analysis, offering insights into the strength and
direction of relationships between variables in language studies.
Importantly, students will understand the principle that correlation does not
imply causation, a critical concept for accurate interpretation.

Moving on to qualitative analysis, you will explore coding
techniques, which involve systematic categorization and labeling of
qualitative data to identify recurring themes or patterns. Through examples
and activities, students will learn how to organize and analyze qualitative
data, enhancing their ability to uncover meaningful insights within complex
datasets. Additionally, the chapter distinguishes between content analysis
and thematic analysis, highlighting their respective focuses, processes, and
applications. By the end of the chapter, you are be equipped with the skills
to apply appropriate data analysis techniques and accurately interpret
statistical tests, enabling them to derive valuable insights within the context
of their research studies.

Reﬂection Questions
1) How might understanding basic statistical measures like averages and
ranges help you make sense of language learning data in your research?
Think about how knowing these numbers could reveal important trends
or patterns in your study participants’ performance.
2) Why is it important to remember that just because two things are
related (like vocabulary size and reading comprehension), it does not
mean one causes the other? Reflect on how this principle might
influence the conclusions you draw from your research findings about
language learning.
3) Imagine you are tasked with analyzing interviews or written responses
from language learners. How would you go about organizing and
interpreting this qualitative data? Consider the steps you would take to
identify common themes or ideas in the participants’ responses.

Research Findings
“Reporting research findings is like trying to solve a Rubik’s cube blindfolded you know there’s a solution somewhere in those colorful blocks,
but it’s a mystery until you line them up just right.”

In the journey of conducting research, reporting findings is a pivotal
step. It is the phase where all your hard work and dedication come to
fruition as you present your discoveries to the academic community. This
chapter will equip you with the essential skills needed to effectively
communicate your research findings. By the end of this chapter, you will be
able to summarize your main findings clearly and concisely, structure your
presentation in a logical and coherent manner, and utilize visual aids to
enhance understanding.

1. Reporting Quantitative Findings
Quantitative research involves the collection and analysis of
numerical data to answer research questions or test hypotheses. When

reporting quantitative findings, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive
overview of your results while maintaining clarity and precision. In this
section, there are three key strategies for effectively reporting quantitative
findings, namely summarizing main findings, structuring the presentation,
and using visual aids.

1.1 Summarize Main Findings
Begin by summarizing the main findings of your research in a
concise and straightforward manner. Focus on the key insights that
emerged from your data analysis, highlighting any significant patterns or
trends. For example, if you conducted a survey to investigate language
learning preferences among college students, your summary might state:

212

RESEARCH WRITING

“The survey findings indicated that the majority of college students
prefer interactive language learning methods over traditional
classroom instruction. Additionally, a significant correlation was found
between language proficiency levels and self-reported motivation to
learn.”

By providing a brief overview of your main findings upfront, you
give readers a clear understanding of the central themes of your research.

1.2 Structure the Presentation
Organize your presentation of quantitative findings in a logical
and coherent manner to guide readers through your research outcomes.
Consider using subheadings to divide your results into relevant sections
based on themes or research objectives.
For example, if your study examined the effectiveness of different
language teaching methods, you could structure your presentation as
follows:
Teaching Method Preferences:

§

Analysis of survey responses regarding preferred
language teaching methods.

§

Comparison of preferences across different
d e m o g r a p h i c g ro u p s ( e . g . , a g e , l a n g u a g e
proficiency level).

Correlation Between Proficiency and Motivation:

§

Presentation of correlation coefficients between
language proficiency levels and self-reported
motivation to learn.

§

Discussion of implications for language teaching
strategies and curriculum development.

By structuring your presentation in this way, you provide
readers with a clear roadmap of your findings, making it easier for
them to navigate and understand your research outcomes.

RESEARCH WRITING

213

1.3 Use Visual Aids
Enhance the presentation of your quantitative findings by
incorporating visual aids such as tables , charts , and graphs . Visual
representations can help clarify complex data and make your findings
more accessible to readers. For instance, Klomkaew and Boontam (2023)
investigates the extent to which paper-based data-driven learning (DDL)
activities can improve Thai EFL students’ grammar learning of conditional
sentences (the second condition), as well as the participants’ attitudes
toward learning through the DDL approach. The study included a bar
graph that visually represented that most of the learners enjoyed DDL
because they found it is good to discover and explore language by
themselves (Fig. 8.1).

Figure 8.1 Bar chart (Klomkaew & Boontam, 2023, p. 37)

By presenting data in visual form, you can effectively communicate
key findings at a glance, allowing readers to quickly grasp the significance
of your research outcomes.

2. Reporting Qualitative Findings
Qualitative research focuses on exploring phenomena through a
detailed analysis of non-numerical data, including interviews, observations,
and textual sources. When reporting qualitative findings, your goal is to
provide rich, descriptive accounts that capture the complexity of the
phenomena under study. In this section, there are three ways to effectively
report qualitative findings, namely providing detailed descriptions,
organizing thematically, and using supporting evidence.

2.1

Provide Detailed Descriptions
When reporting qualitative findings, the researcher should provide
detailed descriptions that offer insights into the nuances of the
phenomena under study. Use quotes, anecdotes, and examples from your
data to illustrate key themes and patterns. By incorporating rich,
descriptive accounts, you can convey the complexity of the languagerelated phenomena you are investigating. For example, if your study
explores the experiences of bilingual individuals, you might include
detailed descriptions of participants’ language use in different social
contexts:
“Participants described code-switching as a natural and fluid
aspect of their bilingual identity, often using different languages to
express different aspects of their cultural heritage. For instance,
one participant recounted how they seamlessly transitioned
between languages when conversing with family members,
blending English and Thai expressions to convey meanings and
emotions.”

By providing detailed descriptions, you can paint a vivid picture of
the language-related phenomena you are examining, allowing readers to
gain a deeper understanding of the topic.

RESEARCH WRITING

217

2.2 Organize Thematically
Organize your qualitative findings thematically to group related
insights into coherent categories or themes. Consider using clear and
descriptive headings to guide readers through your analysis and
highlight the key themes that emerged from your data. For example, if
your study explores the experiences of international students learning
English as a second language, you might organize your findings into
thematic categories such as language learning challenges, cultural
adaptation, and strategies for language acquisition:
Language Learning Challenges:

§

Description of common obstacles faced by international
students when learning English.

§

Illustrative examples of language barriers encountered in
academic and social settings.

Cultural Adaptation:

§

Exploration of strategies used by international students
to adapt to a new cultural and linguistic environment.

§

Reflections on the impact of cultural adaptation on
language proficiency and social integration.

Clearly, you can provide a clear and structured overview of the
insights gleaned from your data analysis by organizing your qualitative
findings thematically.

2.3 Use Supporting Evidence
Support your qualitative findings with evidence from your data,
including quotes, excerpts, or examples that demonstrate the validity and
reliability of your interpretations. Incorporating supporting evidence helps
to establish the credibility of your findings and provides readers with
concrete examples to contextualize your analysis. For instance, if your
study examines the perceptions of language teachers regarding bilingual
education, you might include direct quotes from interview transcripts to
illustrate key themes and insights:

218

RESEARCH WRITING

One participant expressed concerns about the lack of resources available
for bilingual education programs as follows:
“One of the main challenges is the limited availability of instructional
materials tailored to our students’ needs. Many existing resources
are outdated or fail to address the diverse linguistic and cultural
backgrounds of our students. Also, there is a shortage of qualified
bilingual educators and specialized training programs to support
their professional development.” [Participant 1]

By using supporting evidence, you can substantiate your
qualitative findings and enhance the trustworthiness of your research
outcomes.
Activity 8.2: Reporting Qualitative Findings
Task 1
Directions: Read the following excerpt describing a participant’s experience

in a qualitative study. Based on the excerpt, write a detailed description
that offers insights into the nuances of the language-related phenomena
under study. You may think of quotes, anecdotes, or examples to illustrate
key themes and patterns.
“Participants described code-switching as a natural and fluid aspect of their
bilingual identity, often using different languages to express different
aspects of their cultural heritage. For instance, one participant recounted
how they seamlessly transitioned between languages when conversing with
family members, blending English and Thai expressions to convey
meanings and emotions.”

3. Reporting Mixed-Methods Findings
Mixed-methods research provides a valuable opportunity to merge
the strengths of both qualitative and quantitative approaches, resulting in a
more comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena in language
studies. When reporting mixed-methods findings, the researcher should
integrate both types of data effectively to create a coherent narrative. To
effectively report mixed-methods findings, you may consider the following
three tips, that is, integrating findings, highlighting complementary insights,
and using visual integration.

3.1

Integrate Findings
Integrating qualitative and quantitative findings involves
synthesizing data from both approaches to offer a holistic perspective on
the research problem. For example, in a study on language acquisition,
quantitative data might reveal statistical trends in language proficiency
scores, while qualitative data could provide insights into the lived
experiences of bilingual learners. By integrating these findings,
researchers can offer a nuanced understanding of language development
processes.
Quantitative findings from language proficiency tests revealed a

statistically significant improvement in participants’ speaking abilities over
the course of the intervention program. This quantitative data was further
enriched by qualitative insights gathered through semi-structured
interviews, which illuminated the specific strategies and classroom
activities that students found most beneficial for enhancing their oral
communication skills. Integrating these findings provided a comprehensive
understanding of the factors contributing to language development
among second language learners.

220

RESEARCH WRITING

3.2

Highlight Complementary Insights
Highlight the complementary relationship between qualitative and
quantitative insights, demonstrating how each method provides distinct
and valuable perspectives that enhance the overall understanding of the
research findings. For instance, quantitative data may identify correlations
between language proficiency and academic achievement, while
qualitative data might uncover the social and cultural factors influencing
language learning experiences. By highlighting these complementary
insights, researchers can demonstrate the breadth and depth of their
analysis.
The quantitative analysis of language assessment scores identified
a moderate positive correlation between vocabulary acquisition and
reading comprehension among elementary school students. In contrast,
qualitative data obtained through focus group discussions revealed the
diverse reading preferences and habits of students, shedding light on the
contextual factors influencing their engagement with different types of
texts. By juxtaposing these complementary insights, the study elucidated
both the quantitative trends and the qualitative nuances of reading
comprehension in language learning contexts.

3.3

Use Visual Integration
Visual aids play a crucial role in visually integrating mixed-methods
findings, helping readers navigate complex data and relationships.
Consider using visual tools such as matrices, flowcharts, or integrated
diagrams to illustrate connections between qualitative and quantitative
findings. For instance, a matrix could display survey responses alongside
thematic analysis findings, highlighting convergent or divergent patterns.
Visual integration enhances the accessibility and clarity of mixed-methods
research findings, facilitating comprehension for readers.
A visual Integration of mixed-methods findings was achieved
through the creation of a thematic map (Fig. 8.2), which depicted the
interconnectedness between students’ language attitudes, selfperceptions, and academic performance. The map illustrated quantitative
survey data on students’ self-reported language confidence levels

RESEARCH WRITING

221

alongside qualitative excerpts from reflective journals, demonstrating how
students’ perceptions of their language abilities influenced their learning
experiences. This visual representation facilitated a holistic understanding
of the complex interplay between affective factors and language learning
outcomes.

RESEARCH WRITING

Essential Expressions used in Reporting Findings
In research articles, the Results section is structured to systematically
present and detail the findings. When reporting qualitative results, the
researcher typically emphasizes and interprets key themes that have
surfaced during analysis, often using direct excerpts from the raw data for
illustration. In studies that rely on textual analysis, these illustrations might
include direct quotes from primary documents. On the other hand,
quantitative research usually features results displayed in tables and figures.
Authors typically guide readers through these visual representations by first
identifying and summarizing the content of each table or figure, followed
by a detailed examination of noteworthy data points. It is important to
number and title all figures and tables for easy reference.
While in-depth interpretation of the results generally belongs in the
Discussion section, many research articles integrate extensive commentary

on findings directly in the Results section, leading to some articles
combining both sections under a joint heading: “Results and Discussion.”
This format allows for a seamless transition between presenting findings
and interpreting their implications. However, this chapter will focus on only
how to write to report findings, and how to write a discussion will be in the
next chapter.

1. Referring to data in the chart or table
Referring to data in a chart or table when reporting findings serves
to provide visual support and enhance the clarity of the information
presented in the literature review. It allows readers to quickly grasp key
findings and provides a visual representation of the data discussed in the

Research Discussion
In research writing, the Discussion section holds paramount
importance as it serves as the platform for dissecting and interpreting
research findings. This chapter explores the complexities of effectively
discussing research findings, equipping students with the skills necessary to
analyze, interpret, and contextualize their data. By the end of this chapter,
you will be able to draw meaningful conclusions, understand the
implications of their findings, and connect them to both research questions
and existing literature.

1. Highlighting Findings
In the discussion section of a research paper, highlighting the key
findings provides readers with a clear understanding of the study’s
outcomes. This involves summarizing the main results and identifying any
significant patterns or trends observed in the data. In language studies, this
process often entails showcasing the effectiveness of language learning
interventions, understanding language acquisition patterns, or exploring
linguistic phenomena within specific contexts.

In a study investigating the impact of immersive language
learning experiences on vocabulary acquisition among
bilingual children, the key findings may be summarized as
follows:
“The study found that bilingual children exposed to
immersive language learning environments demonstrated
significantly higher levels of vocabulary acquisition compared
to those in traditional classroom settings. Specifically,
children who participated in language immersion programs
showed a 25% increase in vocabulary retention over a sixmonth period, while their counterparts in standard language
classes exhibited only a 10% improvement. This suggests
that immersive language experiences play a crucial role in
enhancing vocabulary development among bilingual
learners.”

Example

234

RESEARCH WRITING

By summarizing the main outcomes and highlighting the significant
difference between the two groups, researchers effectively convey the
essence of their findings to the readers. This clarity allows readers to grasp
the key insights of the study and understand its implications within the
broader context of language acquisition research.

2. Conﬁrming Other Researchers’ Evidence
In language studies, confirming or refuting existing evidence is a
crucial aspect of scholarly discourse. Researchers often compare their
findings with those of other studies to validate or challenge prevailing
theories, methodologies, or empirical observations. This process helps
situate the research within the broader scholarly conversation, contributing
to the cumulative advancement of knowledge in the field.
Consider a study examining the effectiveness of grammar
instruction methods in improving English language
proficiency among adult learners. Upon reviewing existing
literature, the researchers found several studies supporting
the efficacy of communicative language teaching (CLT) in
enhancing language skills. They note that previous research
has consistently demonstrated the benefits of interactive,
task-based approaches to grammar instruction.
In their own study, the researchers implemented a CLT
approach and observed significant improvements in
participants’ grammar accuracy and communicative
competence. These findings align with existing evidence,
confirming the efficacy of CLT in promoting language
learning outcomes among adult learners. By corroborating
previous research findings, the study adds credibility to the
body of literature supporting CLT as a pedagogically sound
approach to language instruction.
Example

Through this process of confirming other researchers’ evidence,
scholars contribute to the ongoing dialogue in language studies, reinforcing

RESEARCH WRITING

235

established principles and identifying areas for further investigation or
refinement.

3. Comparing Literature
In the field of language studies, comparing research findings to the
existing body of literature is essential for evaluating the coherence and
consistency of knowledge within the discipline. Researchers analyze how
their results align with previous studies, identifying areas of convergence
and divergence to deepen understanding and inform future research
directions.
Suppose a study investigates the impact of digital language
learning platforms on vocabulary acquisition among
elementary school students. Upon reviewing existing
literature, the researchers find a range of studies examining
the effectiveness of technology-enhanced language learning
interventions. Some studies report positive outcomes,
suggesting that interactive digital tools can enhance
vocabulary retention and engagement among young
learners. However, other studies present conflicting findings,
highlighting challenges such as limited access to technology
or distractions caused by screen time.
In their own study, the researchers observe a significant
improvement in vocabulary acquisition among students who
used a digital language learning app compared to those who
received traditional instruction. These findings align with
previous research suggesting the potential benefits of
technology-enhanced language learning for vocabulary
development. However, the researchers also note limitations
in the existing literature, such as a lack of longitudinal studies
or variations in instructional design across different digital
platforms.
Example

236

RESEARCH WRITING

Through a critical comparison of literature, researchers contribute to
the ongoing dialogue in language studies by synthesizing existing
knowledge and identifying areas for further investigation or refinement.
This process helps to advance theoretical and practical understandings of
language learning and teaching methodologies.

4. Comparing and Contrasting Views
In language studies, researchers often encounter diverse
perspectives or viewpoints emerging from their findings, which may lead to
contrasting interpretations of the data. Exploring these differing views and
comparing them provides valuable insights into the complexity of
language-related phenomena and encourages critical engagement with the
research outcomes.

Consider a study examining the effectiveness of bilingual
education programs in promoting language proficiency
among elementary school students. The researchers collect
data through interviews with teachers, observations of
classroom interactions, and assessments of students’
language skills.
Upon analysis, the researchers identify two main perspectives
emerging from their findings:
- Support for Bilingual Education : Some teachers and

students demonstrate strong support for bilingual education
programs, emphasizing the benefits of maintaining and
celebrating linguistic diversity in the classroom. They
highlight the positive impact of bilingual instruction on
students’ language development, cultural identity, and
academic achievement.
- Challenges and Concerns : Conversely, other teachers

express concerns about the practical implementation and
sustainability of bilingual education initiatives. They note
challenges such as limited resources, insufficient training for
educators, and resistance from stakeholders.
Example

RESEARCH WRITING

237

By comparing and contrasting these views, researchers gain a
deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding bilingual education
and its implications for language learning outcomes. This nuanced analysis
fosters critical reflection on the role of language policies and pedagogical
practices in promoting linguistic diversity and educational equity.

5. Questioning Current Views
In language studies, researchers often encounter opportunities to
question established views or assumptions in the field, challenging
prevailing theories or paradigms. This process of critical inquiry stimulates
scholarly debate and pushes the boundaries of understanding, leading to
innovative insights and theoretical advancements.
Suppose a study investigates the relationship between
language proficiency and cognitive development in bilingual
children. Previous research has suggested a positive
correlation between bilingualism and cognitive flexibility, with
bilingual individuals exhibiting enhanced problem-solving
abilities and cognitive control compared to monolinguals.
However, upon conducting their study, the researchers
observe nuanced findings that prompt them to question the
current views in the field:
- Interrogating Assumptions: The researchers find that while

bilingual children indeed demonstrate advantages in certain
cognitive domains, such as executive function and
metalinguistic awareness, the relationship between
bilingualism and cognitive development is more complex than
previously assumed. They discover variations in cognitive
outcomes among bilingual individuals based on factors such
as language dominance, proficiency levels, and sociocultural
context. These findings challenge the simplistic notion of
bilingualism as a universally beneficial cognitive asset and
prompt researchers to reconsider the underlying mechanisms
driving cognitive advantages in bilingual populations.

- Proposing Alternative Explanations : Furthermore, the

researchers propose alternative explanations for the observed
patterns, suggesting that environmental factors, such as
socioeconomic status, parental involvement, and educational
opportunities, may play a significant role in shaping cognitive
development among bilingual children. They argue that a
holistic understanding of bilingualism should consider the
interplay between linguistic, cognitive, and sociocultural
factors, moving beyond deterministic views of language
learning and cognitive functioning. By questioning the current
views and proposing alternative explanations, the researchers
contribute to a more understanding of bilingualism and its
implications for cognitive development.
- Identifying Areas for Further Investigation : Lastly, the

researchers highlight the need for future studies to explore
the longitudinal effects of bilingualism on cognitive
development, examining how language experiences unfold
over time and interact with other developmental factors. They
emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary research
collaborations and methodological innovations to address
complex questions about bilingualism and cognition
comprehensively. By identifying areas for further investigation,
the researchers pave the way for continued advancements in
the field of language studies, encouraging scholars to critically
evaluate existing knowledge and pursue new avenues of
inquiry.

6. Making Generalizations
In the field of language studies, making generalizations is a critical
aspect of research that allows researchers to draw overarching conclusions
and contribute to theoretical understanding, practical applications, and
future research directions. By synthesizing their findings into coherent
narratives, researchers highlight the significance of their work and pave the
way for continued inquiry.

RESEARCH WRITING

Consider a research study that investigates the impact of
digital language learning platforms on vocabulary acquisition
among adult learners of English as a foreign language (EFL).
After conducting a comprehensive analysis of data collected
through surveys, interviews, and pre-post assessments, the
researchers make generalizations based on their findings:
- Contributions to Theory: The study found that digital

language learning platforms offer valuable opportunities for
adult EFL learners to engage in self-directed learning and
practice vocabulary skills outside the classroom. By providing
interactive exercises, multimedia resources, and personalized
feedback, these platforms cater to diverse learning styles and
preferences, enhancing learners’ motivation and engagement.
The findings contribute to SLA theories by highlighting the
importance of technology-mediated learning environments in
facilitating language learning processes and fostering learner
autonomy.
- Implications for Practice: Furthermore, the researchers

identify practical implications for educators, curriculum
developers, and language learners seeking to leverage digital
tools for vocabulary instruction. They recommend integrating
digital language learning platforms into EFL curriculum
design, offering learners access to a wide range of authentic
materials and interactive activities to supplement traditional
classroom instruction.
- Future Research Directions: Finally, the researchers outline

potential avenues for future research to build upon their
findings and address unanswered questions in the field. They
suggest longitudinal studies to examine the long-term effects
of digital language learning platforms on vocabulary retention
and proficiency development among adult EFL learners.
Additionally, they propose comparative studies to evaluate
the effectiveness of different types of digital tools and
instructional approaches in diverse learner populations and
educational contexts. By identifying gaps in the literature and
proposing future research directions, the study contributes to
ongoing discussions in the field of language studies.

Moves in Discussions
This section outlines the essential components of academic
discussions in research writing. This section explains how this part of a
research paper enables researchers to critically analyze their findings,
consider alternative interpretations, and discuss the broader implications of
their work. By understanding the typical elements involved in discussions,
researchers can effectively convey the significance of their findings and
contribute meaningfully to their field.
Ruiying and Allison (2003) created a detailed two-layer hierarchical
move structure for discussion sections in applied linguistics, drawing on a
corpus of eight discussion sections from three reputable journals. This
structure encompasses both moves and sub-moves, or “steps,” aimed at
highlighting the different communicative purposes of each move and
making them more prominent (see Table 9.1).

Move 1: Background information
This move is designed to prepare readers for the subsequent report
or discussion of the results. It usually encompasses key elements such as
research questions, study aims and objectives, theoretical background,
established knowledge, and the research methodology. Move 1 is typically
considered optional (Amnuai & Wannaruk, 2013).
§ This section outlines the discussion , focusing on the
primary objectives of the research.
§ The upcoming discussion is structured around the main
hypotheses and the theoretical framework of the study.
§

Example

Move 2: Reporting results
The purpose of this move is to present the study’s results. In many
research articles, Move 2 often overlaps with Move 4 (Commenting on
results), indicating that the results are frequently accompanied by
commentary. Various linguistic signals or expressions related to numerical
values, reporting verbs, and statements about upcoming outcomes
involving graphs, figures, examples, and tables are commonly used to
signal this move. Both past and present simple tenses are employed in this
section.
§ In Figure 2 , the results indicated a significant difference
between the experimental and control groups in terms of
vocabulary retention.
§ In Table 5 , an examination of the data shows a positive
correlation between students’ motivation levels and their
language acquisition rates.
§

Example

242

RESEARCH WRITING

Move 3: Summarizing results
This move aims to summarize the results. Linguistic indicators for
this move include summarizing verbs, nouns, and phrases such as "to sum
up," "to summarize," "in summary," and "in brief." The passive voice is
commonly used in this move.
§

To sum up, the data indicated that the intervention had

a significant impact on students' reading
comprehension skills.
Example

Move 4: Commenting on results
The purpose of this move is to highlight the significance and
implications of the research findings within the context of the relevant field.
Move 4 is considered central, as it involves commenting on the results
through four steps: ‘Interpreting results,’ ‘Comparing results with literature,’
‘Accounting for results,’ and ‘Evaluating results.’ Therefore, this move is
deemed both obligatory and conventional (Yang & Allison, 2003).

Step 1: Interpreting results
In this step, authors make claims or generalizations based
on their findings. Words indicating certainty or tentativeness, such
as "seem," "suggest," "indicate," "appear," and modal verbs like
"may," "might," "would," "could," and "likely to," are used. These
linguistic signals are typically in the present simple tense, either in
active or passive voice.
§ This indicates that the test takers did not fully utilize
the remaining facilitative features, such as the
dictionary, thesaurus, or Self-reflective Reminder
Questions.
§ This finding suggested that students who
participated in interactive activities showed greater
engagement and understanding.
§

Example

RESEARCH WRITING

243

Step 2: Comparing results with literature
This step involves comparing the study's findings with those
of previous research. Distinct linguistic features include "be" plus
adjectives (e.g., be consistent with, be similar to) or phrases such as
"agree with," "reported in," "run counter to," and "supported
those of” (See Fig. 9.1). These signals often appear with citations.
§ As noted, these results align with Smith's (2020)
conclusion that collaborative learning enhances
language retention.
§ This observation is consistent with Imsa-ard's
(2021) findings, indicating that multimedia tools
significantly improve comprehension skills.
Example

Figure 9.1 An example of comparing results with literature

(Imsa-ard & Tangkiengsirisin, 2023)

244

RESEARCH WRITING

Step 3: Accounting for results
In this step, researchers explain the observed differences or
unexpected outcomes. Rational explanations are highlighted by
phrases such as "because," "possible explanation for," "it is
possible," "may be caused by," and "can be explained by."
§

These results can be attributed to the

participants' familiarity with digital learning
platforms, which facilitated their engagement.
§

This discrepancy might be due to variations in
i n s t r u c t i o n a l m e t h o d s b e t w e e n d i ff e re n t
educational institutions

Example

Step 4: Evaluating results
In this step, researchers assess their results by stating the
strengths and weaknesses. This step is usually optional.
§

Although the sample size was limited, the
findings provide valuable insights into language
learning behaviors.
Example

Move 5: Summarizing the study
This move seeks to present the main findings of the research study
to the readers. It is often considered optional in many studies. The
keywords used to indicate this move are similar to those found in Move 3;
however, the key distinction is that summary or conclusive phrases, such as
“in sum” or “in conclusion,” are typically followed by statements
concerning the overall results. In contrast, those in Move 3 are followed by
specific results.

In summary, this research evaluated the role of peer

feedback in improving writing skills, demonstrating
notable progress in students' writing proficiency.
§

In conclusion, the study assessed the effectiveness of

blended learning approaches in language instruction,
revealing substantial benefits for student engagement
and comprehension.
§

Example

Move 6: Evaluating the study
This move aims to assess the overall study by identifying limitations,
highlighting contributions, or evaluating the methodology.

Step 1: Indicating limitations
This step describes the limitations of the research. It often
appears alongside Move 7 Step 1 (Making suggestions) or Move 7
Step 2 (Recommending further study).
§ It is important to acknowledge that, however, the
study’s generalizability is limited due to the small
sample size and specific demographic focus.
§ One limitation of this study is the reliance on selfreported data, which may be subject to response
biases.
Example
§

Step 2: Indicating signiﬁcance
This step allows authors to highlight the strengths of the
study, emphasizing its significance for applications or implications.
Statements in the present simple tense, relating to the importance
of the research, are commonly used.

Step 3: Evaluating methodology
This step comments on the strengths or weaknesses of the
research methodology. It is usually optional and often uses tentative
language related to design, model, or approach.
§ Although the qualitative approach provides indepth understanding, it may not capture the
broader trends present in larger populations.
§ The experimental design was robust in controlling
variables, but future studies should consider
longitudinal approaches to observe long-term
effects.
Example

Move 7: Deductions from the research
In this move, researchers draw inferences from the results by
suggesting solutions to the problems identified, proposing areas for further
research, or drawing pedagogical implications.

Step 1: Making suggestions
This step allows researchers to highlight how their study
contributes to existing knowledge and provides guidelines for
addressing the problems identified.
§

To address the identified challenges, i t i s
suggested that curriculum developers
incorporate more interactive activities that
promote student engagement.

§

§

§

§

The results imply that incorporating multimedia
tools in language lessons can enhance students'
comprehension and retention.
These findings underline the importance of
fostering a collaborative learning environment to
improve language acquisition among students.
These results have practical implications for EFL
vocabulary instruction, indicating that tailored
vocabulary activities could significantly enhance
learning outcomes.
Example

What is an implication?
In research, “implications” refer to the potential effects,
consequences, or impacts of study findings on existing knowledge,
practice, policy, or future research. They extend beyond the specific context
of the study to suggest broader applications and inform decision-making.
The following is a breakdown of how implications can manifest in different
aspects of research, that is to say, theoretical implications, practical
implications, policy implications, and implications for future research.

1. Theoretical Implications
These relate to how the findings contribute to or modify existing
theories or concepts. A study might support, refute, or refine theoretical
frameworks, leading to new interpretations or understandings within a field.

248

RESEARCH WRITING

2. Practical Implications
These implications focus on the real-world applications of the
research findings. They offer insights into how the results can be used to
improve practices, processes, or behaviors in specific settings, such as
educational practices, clinical treatments, or business strategies.

3. Policy Implications
When findings affect policy-making, they have policy implications.
This can include suggestions for changes in laws, regulations, or policies at
local, national, or international levels based on the evidence provided by
the research.

4. Implications for Future Research
This involves identifying new questions or gaps that have emerged
from the study, suggesting new methodologies or areas that future studies
could explore. This helps to advance the field by indicating the next steps
in research progression.

Examples in Language Education Research
If a study finds that immersive bilingual education programs
significantly enhance students’ cognitive flexibility, the implications might
be as in the following examples.
-

Theoretical : Supports theories suggesting that bilingualism can

enhance cognitive abilities.
-

Practical: Schools might use these findings to justify integrating or

enhancing bilingual programs.
-

Policy : Educational policymakers might consider mandating or

funding bilingual education programs more broadly.
-

Future Research : Future studies could explore which aspects of

bilingual education are most beneficial or how these effects vary
across different age groups.

RESEARCH WRITING

249

Activity 9.1: Discussing Research Findings
Directions : Read the following research extract and analyze it carefully,

paying attention to the key findings, comparisons, and interpretations
presented. Then discuss the following questions:
1) How do the researchers confirm or refute existing evidence in the field?
2) What comparisons are made to the existing literature, and what insights
are gained from these comparisons?
3) How do the researchers present and contrast different viewpoints or
interpretations of the data?

Extract (adapted from Imsa-ard & Tangkiengsirisin, 2023, pp. 67–68)
“Previous research has demonstrated that language instructors tend to
have minimal or inadequate language assessment literacy (e.g., DeLuca & Johnson,
2017; Watmani et al., 2020). Broadly speaking, this research seemed to resemble
findings of past studies suggesting that language instructors had low levels of
language assessment literacy. Despite the fact that the majority of participants
considered assessment to be vital, their language assessment knowledge remained
weak in many assessment domains. According to the previously presented findings,
participants were highly literate and skilled in articulating clear learning intentions,
although this result seemed to contradict what was neglected in the 1990
standards. This could be supported by Edwards (2013), who demonstrates that
teachers must communicate their intents and aims to their students as the first step
in a successful assessment plan (Kennedy, 2008). Since learning intentions are
closely related to the focus of what is taught and assessed, establishing clear
learning intentions could help pave the way for students to master key concepts
and learning progressions.
Although studies concerning language assessment literacy are limited, this
study seemed to contradict the findings of Davidheiser (2013) indicating that
teachers have limited knowledge of how technology is involved in assessment.
Moreover, the findings from this study revealed that university lecturers believed
that digitally-mediated language assessment was important for them. The
explanation for this contradiction may be that participants in this study may have
experienced the use of technology for assessment in virtual classrooms due to the
pandemic, thus this might have allowed them to learn more and better prepare for
the utilization of technology in their assessment.”

Writing a Research Paper
“If research papers were a sport, citations would be the coach always yelling,
‘Remember where you came from!!’”

After completing your research study, you may have to write a
research report or paper to contribute new knowledge or discoveries to the
academic community. Many novice researchers may not fully understand
the specific components required in a research paper, as these can differ
significantly across disciplines. To ensure alignment and clarity, it is
recommended that you consult with your research advisor. This will help
both of you stay on the same track regarding the expectations and
requirements. Below, this chapter provides a basic skeleton for a research
paper, adapted from Mackey and Gass (2018), to guide you in structuring

Research Title
While it constitutes a very small part of the research paper, the title
holds significant importance as the initial point of contact between the
writer and potential reader. It can influence whether or not the paper will
be read (Haggan, 2004). Titles may differ based on the nature of the field.
In the sciences, titles tend to present information clearly and directly,
conveying either the findings of the paper or its main focus. In contrast,
titles in the field of literature often aim to captivate the reader through a
form of verbal flirtation, enticing them with suggestive and intriguingly
enigmatic hints about the pleasures that await within the text.
A good research title possesses several key characteristics that
enhance its effectiveness and relevance to the study. Some of the main
attributes include clarity, conciseness, accuracy, specificity, interest, and
optimization.
1) Clarity : The title should clearly indicate the focus of the research
without using too much technical jargon or overly complex language. It
should be understandable to both specialists in the field and
knowledgeable outsiders.
Example: Second Language Acquisition among Children and Adults: A
Comparative Study
Explanation: This title clearly communicates that the research focuses
on comparing how children and adults acquire a second language. It
avoids technical terms that might be unfamiliar to a broader audience,
making it accessible.

RESEARCH WRITING

257

2) Conciseness: While being descriptive, the title should also be concise.
It should communicate the essence of the research without being overly
verbose, ideally in fewer than 20 words or even 15 words in many
journals.
Example: Gender Differences in EFL Pronunciation: A Study of Thai EFL
Learners
Explanation: This title is concise yet informative. It tells the reader about
the focus (gender differences in pronunciation), the context (EFL), and
the specific group being studied (Thai learners) without unnecessary
words.
3) Accuracy: The title must accurately reflect the content and scope of the
research. It should align well with the keywords, research questions,
methodology, and findings discussed in the paper.
Example: The Impact of Multimedia on English Vocabulary Retention
Explanation: The title accurately reflects that the research paper will
discuss how using multimedia affects the retention of English
vocabulary. It promises a specific focus, which is crucial for setting the
reader’s expectations about the content.

4) Specificity : A good title provides specific details about the research
focus. This might include the geographical location, time period
studied, or the specific population or phenomenon being examined.
Example: Code-Switching in Bilingual Thai-English Communities in
International Schools in Thailand
Explanation: This title is specific about the linguistic phenomenon
(code-switching), the community under study (bilingual Thai-English),
and the geographical focus (International Schools in Thailand). Such
specificity helps in attracting readers who are interested in these
particular aspects.

258

RESEARCH WRITING

5) Interest : The title should be interesting enough to attract and engage
readers. Using dynamic and pertinent terms can pique the interest of
potential readers and draw them into reading more.
Example: Unlocking the Secrets of Silent Reading in Multilingual Adults
Explanation: The use of intriguing terms like “Unlocking the Secrets”
makes the title appealing and stimulates curiosity. It suggests a deeper
exploration into the silent reading practices among multilingual adults,
which can attract a broader readership.
6) Optimization : Including relevant keywords in the title can help in
optimizing it for search engines and indexing services, making the
paper more visible and accessible to other researchers searching for
related topics.
Example: Narrative Structures in Autistic Children’s Language
Development
Explanation: This title includes key phrases likely searched by
researchers in similar fields—’narrative structures,’ ‘autistic children,’
and ‘language development.’ Such keywords help in optimizing the
title for search engines and databases, increasing the visibility of the
research.

Abstracts
Research abstracts (RAs) are concise, informative texts that act as
screening tools or previews for research papers, conference presentations,
and other forms of communication. The abstract is a critical component of
research articles, allowing readers to grasp the overall scope of the
research. Most readers typically examine the article’s title and abstract as a
gateway to the content, helping them decide whether to purchase or read
the article (Alhuqbani, 2013; Kosasih, 2018). Therefore, the primary purpose
of research article abstracts is to provide a brief summary of the article's
content (Martín-Martín, 2005).
Many novice researchers may be uncertain about what to include in
an abstract. Generally, abstracts provide information on the purpose ,
methods , and findings of the articles. However, Hyland (2000) suggests

that a well-structured abstract should encompass all five essential
components ( Introduction - Purpose - Method - Product - Conclusion ) in a
linear order. Refer to Fig. 10.1 for an overview of the research abstract.

RESEARCH WRITING

261

Figure 10.1 An example of a research abstract with its component

(Imsa-ard, 2020, p. 140)
However, in many research papers, the Introduction part is usually
omitted (see Fig. 10.2). This observation is also supported by Vathanalaoha
and Tangkiengsirisin (2018), indicating that a background move or
introduction part was apparently disregarded by Thai authors. The most

frequent move sequence is ‘Purpose-Method-Result-Conclusion’.

262

RESEARCH WRITING

Figure 10.2 A research abstract without an introduction (Imsa-ard, 2022, p. 1)

As clearly seen from the examples, most research abstracts have
their own ‘convention’ – rhetorical moves. The length of a move can vary,
ranging from a phrase to several sentences, and certain moves may be
omitted based on the abstract’s intended audience and purpose. Please
take a look at Table 10.1, Hyland’s (2000, p. 67) five-move framework is one
of the most popular frameworks adopted when writing an abstract.

RESEARCH WRITING

263

1. Move 1: Introduction
The introduction move is typically found in the first sentence of the
abstract and is used to establish the research background and context of
the study.

2. Move 2: Purpose
This move generally appears in the first 2–3 sentences of the
abstract, following the introduction move. It indicates the purpose of the
study and outlines the study's intentions.

264

RESEARCH WRITING

In this move, formulaic sequences are often evident. Many journal
articles commonly utilize phrases such as “this paper,” “this research,” and
“this study.” Analyzing these formulaic patterns reveals frequently used
deictic terms and reporting verbs. The use of “this” suggests that the
author is trying to emphasize their own research study.

3. Move 3: Method
This move offers information and elaborates on the research
designs, procedures, assumptions, approaches, or data related to the study.
Specifically, it addresses how the research study is conducted. To complete
this move, several steps are involved: describing the materials used,
outlining the research procedures including instruments and methods, and
detailing the data analysis process.

4. Move 4: Product
This move presents the main findings or results, the arguments
made, or what was achieved based on the research methodologies
employed. It is one of the most commonly found moves compared to
others. A notable feature of this move is the explicit use of complement
clauses (Hyland, 2004), which highlights the promotional aspects of abstract
writing.

5. Move 5: Conclusion
This final move is used to make claims about the study and to
conclude the implications drawn from the results. Not all research abstracts
include this move, which aligns with Li’s (2011) finding that well-organized
research papers do not require conclusions to engage interested readers.

266

RESEARCH WRITING

As mentioned earlier, this overview highlights what should be
included in a research abstract. When examining the details more closely,
Swales and Feak’s (2009) model offers a thorough analysis of the text, which
is beneficial for novice researchers compared to other frameworks. As
shown in Table 10.2 below, Swales and Feak’s (2009) model includes the
following variables: length of the abstract, use of tense, presence of
citations, use of first-person pronouns, and acronyms.

Table 10.2

In summary, Imsa-ard (2021) examined the move structure and
microstructure of article abstracts published in a leading journal focused on
language education and acquisition in Thailand. The findings indicated that
three moves– purpose , method , and product –were most commonly
included in the abstracts, while the other two moves–introduction and
conclusion –were absent in some cases. Additionally, most research

abstracts contained fewer than 150 words and predominantly used present
tense verbs, along with some acronyms. Only a few abstracts included
citations and first-person pronouns.

Introduction
The “Introduction” section of a research paper plays a pivotal role
in setting the stage for the reader, providing essential background, and
highlighting the significance of the study. Unlike the introduction chapter in
a research proposal with separate sub-sections (see Chapter 2), the

RESEARCH WRITING

269

introduction section in a research paper follows a strategic progression due
to a paucity of space. It effectively bridges the general research topic with
the specific inquiry or argument at the heart of the study, serving as the
foundational framework that guides the reader through the ensuing
scholarly discourse.
An effective introduction follows a strategic progression, beginning
broadly by establishing a context for the research topic to outlining the
purposes (see Fig. 10.3). It explores a succinct review of existing scholarship
to lay the groundwork and show the reader the current state of knowledge
on the topic. This review is not exhaustive but focuses on the most relevant
studies to build a case for the new research. From this broader perspective,
the introduction then narrows down to the specific argument or research
question that the paper addresses, pinpointing the unique contribution of
the study.

Figure 10.3 CARS model (Swales & Feak, 2012)

Move 1 Establishing a territory
This move involves demonstrating the importance of the research
field. Authors may highlight the popularity or critical significance of the
topic and review key pieces of related literature.

270

RESEARCH WRITING

1.1 Argue for the centrality of your research area

-

Highlight the significance of your research topic:

Why does this topic matter?

-

Define a specific issue within your topic area:

What specific challenge are you addressing? What are the
deficiencies in this critical area?

-

Describe the impact and implications of the issue:

Why is this issue critical? Who or what is affected, and what are
the potential consequences if the issue remains unresolved?

1.2 Argue that current (real-world) e^orts to address the
problem are insu^icient

-

Detail the existing solutions or measures taken to mitigate
the issue: What actions have been implemented to tackle this

significant and impactful problem?

-

Explain the shortcomings of these measures:

Why are these efforts insufficient to fully resolve the issue?
Why do they fall short?

Move 2 Establishing a niche
The second move contrasts with the first by identifying a gap in the
existing research, raising new questions, or noting a problem in previous
studies. This move justifies the need for the current research.

2.1 What previous scholarly research has been conducted
into your problem?

-

What is the current academic consensus? On which existing
findings are you building, or which are you
challenging/refuting?

2.2 What are the limitations of that research?

-

Where do current studies fall short (gaps)? What critical points
have not been addressed by existing research?

NB: “no one has done this before” is not a sufficient reason on its own.

RESEARCH WRITING

271

2.3 Options for establishing a niche:
Ø Counter-claiming: Identifying errors or incorrect assumptions
in previous work.
Ø Indicating a gap: Highlighting unexplored areas that your
research aims to cover.
Ø Raising a question or making an inference: Pointing out areas
that are ambiguous or poorly understood.
Ø Continuing a tradition: Extending or expanding upon existing
research trajectories.

Move 3 Occupying the niche
In the final move, the researcher explicitly states the purpose of the
current study, outlines the research questions or hypotheses, and may also
mention the methodology. This part of the introduction directly sets up the
research that will be discussed in detail in the rest of the paper.

3.1 Articulate the purpose of your research

-

3.5 State the structure of your paper

-

What is the structure of the rest of the document, and how
does it expand on the narrative introduced in your
introduction?

Activity 10.3: Crafting Effective Introductions for Research Papers
Task 1
Directions : Read the following introduction. Identify and highlight

sentences or paragraphs corresponding to each move in the CARS model.
Discuss with partners how each move contributes to the overall
effectiveness of the introduction.
Introduction (adapted from Bowen & Van Waes, 2020, pp. 323–324)
“The ability to write academically involves categorizing and rationalizing both
concrete and abstract phenomena as part of scientific discourse (Halliday & Martin, 1993). In
linguistic terms, this discourse is typically realized as a clustering of features (or patterns of
co-occurrence), invariably deemed a variety, register, or style of English. For research
purposes, these patterns are investigated in terms of quantifiable dimensions, qualitative
categories, or a combination of both. Text linguistics, for example, typically includes one (or
more) of the following broad categories: lexicogrammatical intricacy (Biber, 2006; Martin,
1991); grammatical metaphor (Liardét, 2013; Thompson, 2009); tightly knit structures—at the
macro (Gardner & Nesi, 2013) and micro levels (Uccelli et al., 2013); lexical density (Beers &
Nagy, 2009; Uccelli et al., 2013); appropriate “voice/stance” (Matsuda & Jeffery, 2012);
discourse organizers (Biber, 2006; Hyland, 2005); and the use of formulaic sequences (Biber
& Barbieri, 2007), to name but a few.
However, these phenomena also have to be linked cotextually and contextually in
appropriate ways, forming text that progresses logically from one piece of information to the
next. To do this, a writer makes interlocking choices of function and form, forging connections
between words, groups, and clauses to create a synthesis called “texture” (Halliday & Hasan,
1976). The metaphor of text as fabric is frequently drawn upon when defining texture, where
different threads of meaning are woven together, realized by phenomena such as thematic
patterning (Davies, 1997), lexical organization (Hasan, 1985), grammatical cohesion (Halliday
& Hasan, 1976), participant tracking (Martin, 1992), and even evaluative “pulses” (Hood,
2009; Thompson & Zhou, 2000). However, many students seem to struggle to create such
texture in longer academic texts (Carroll et al., 2000; Mauranen, 1996, p. 199).
In this study, we use texture—an area that is known to create problems for student
writers—as a sensitizing concept to explore revision activity in functional terms. First, then,
this study contributes to an understanding of texture in unfolding written academic text by
examining how a successful undergraduate fine-tunes text through revision activity.
Specifically, it looks at revision placement in terms of one aspect of texture: Theme/Rheme
choices as outlined in Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL). Second, this study seeks to
advance an interdisciplinary dialogue between the mechanics of in-process revisions and the

RESEARCH WRITING

273

functions/structures of these revisions via a text linguistic approach (SFL). It does so by
exploring one possible means by which we can combine keystroke logging with an
established theory of language. Third, this is one of the first studies—if not the first—to
explore unfolding language choices in (academic) texts across multiple sessions in a
naturalized (nonexperimental) setting.”

Conclusion
The “Conclusion” section of a research paper is important as it
synthesizes the findings, restates the main ideas, acknowledges the
limitations, and often suggests directions for future research. This section
rounds off the study by reiterating its importance and suggesting how
future work can build upon the existing findings. Here is a breakdown of
these elements with explanations and examples from language-related
research:

1. Restatement of the Main Idea of the Study
Key Feature : This involves summarizing the study’s central thesis or

argument, emphasizing how the findings have addressed the research
question.
This study has demonstrated that immersive language
learning environments significantly enhance language
retention and fluency compared to traditional classroom
set t i ngs. By engagi ng l ear ner s t hrough real - wor l d
simulations, their language acquisition mirrors natural
learning processes more closely than conventional methods.
Example

RESEARCH WRITING

277

2. Limitations of the Study
Key Feature: Acknowledging the limitations of the research is crucial for

transparency and for contextualizing the findings. It shows the scope of the
study and where caution should be applied in interpreting the results.
One limitation of this study is its small sample size, which
consisted primarily of adult learners in urban settings. As
such, the findings may not be generalizable to younger
learners or those in rural or suburban areas. Additionally, the
study’s duration of six months may not fully capture longterm retention and fluency improvements.
Example

3. Suggestions for Future Research
Key Feature: Proposing areas for future research can help to address gaps

left by the current study and encourage other researchers to explore these
questions further.
Future research should consider a broader demographic,
including diverse age groups and learning environments, to
evaluate the effectiveness of immersive language learning
tools universally. Longitudinal studies spanning several years
would also provide deeper insights into the long-term
impacts of immersive learning on language fluency.
Example

278

RESEARCH WRITING

Example in Context: Language Acquisition Research
Now, let’s consider a hypothetical conclusion for a study on the
impact of multimedia tools on vocabulary acquisition among EFL students:
Conclusion:
This study has highlighted the effectiveness of multimedia tools in enhancing
vocabulary acquisition among EFL students, aligning with the hypothesis that visual
and auditory aids can significantly boost language learning compared to text-only
methods. However, this study was limited by its focus on adult learners in a
university setting, which may not reflect the experiences of younger learners or
those in informal educational contexts. Therefore, future research should expand to
include diverse age groups and learning environments to determine the broader
applicability of these findings. Additionally, investigating the long-term retention of
vocabulary acquired through multimedia tools would offer valuable insights into the
sustainability of such educational interventions.

Explanation

In this example, the conclusion effectively restates the study’s main idea,
acknowledges its limitations, and suggests practical avenues for further
investigation, fulfilling the essential roles expected of a robust conclusion in
academic research.

Summary
The chapter on writing a research paper provides comprehensive
guidance, from crafting compelling research titles to writing effective
conclusions. It begins by explaining the characteristics of a good research
title, emphasizing clarity, accuracy, and the ability to reflect the content and
scope of the research. This is followed by insights into structuring a
coherent abstract, which serves as a concise preview of the research
findings and methodologies. The chapter further explores how to write the
introduction using the CARS model, which helps in establishing the
research territory, identifying gaps, and outlining the study’s purpose clearly
and persuasively.
Further, the chapter guides you on how to present methods and
results effectively, ensuring that the research design and findings are

RESEARCH WRITING

279

communicated with precision and clarity. The discussion section is outlined
as a critical component where the implications of findings are debated in
the context of existing literature, providing a deeper understanding of the
study’s impact. Finally, the conclusion ties all elements together, restating
the main idea, acknowledging limitations, and suggesting areas for future
research. This structured approach not only aids in writing a coherent
research paper but also equips you with the skills to critically engage with
academic content and contribute meaningfully to their fields of study.

Reﬂection Questions
1) Reflecting on the CARS model for writing introductions, which aspect
do you find most challenging when establishing a research space, and
why? Why?
2) Considering the different components of a research paper discussed in
this chapter, which section do you feel is most crucial for effectively
communicating your research, and why?
3) How have your views on the importance of a well-crafted introduction
changed after reading this chapter?
“Writing a research paper is like cooking soup.
You throw in all your ideas and hope nothing boils over
before you find the perfect seasoning!”

CHAPTER 11

APA 7 Referencing Style

Chapter Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. understand the basics of APA 7th Edition;
2. apply APA formatting to various sources in both in-text
citations and reference list entries; and

3. utilize APA style in research writing to ensure academic

integrity and adherence to professional standards in your
work

Pre-reading Questions
1. What are the key components of an APA 7th edition
reference list entry?
2. How does in-text citation differ from a reference list entry
in APA style?
3. Why is it important to follow a standardized citation style
like APA in academic writing?

RESEARCH WRITING

283

Introduction
“Why did the researcher break up with APA style?
Because it was too demanding and always wanted things cited its way!”

In this chapter, we will explore the intricacies of APA 7th Edition
referencing style, an essential aspect of academic writing. Although there
are several applications or programs that could help you generate the
references or citations, they might not work very well in some sources due
to lack of information given. Thus, learning how to write citations and
references ca help you increase the credibility of your research paper.
Proper citation and referencing not only demonstrate your credibility as a
researcher but also ensure that your work adheres to professional standards
of integrity and attribution.

Figure 11.1 Formatting in-text citations in APA style 7th edition (Bond, 2019)

In academic writing, various referencing styles have emerged, each
serving distinct purposes. Among these styles, four are commonly used:
namely APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language
Association), Harvard, and Chicago. The APA referencing style is particularly
prevalent in fields such as social sciences and language education, making
it the focus of this chapter. This chapter will explore the intricacies of the
APA referencing style, which is widely adopted in scholarly journals and
research publications in these disciplines.

284

RESEARCH WRITING

In-text Citations
In-text citations are crucial in APA 7 referencing style as they enable
readers to trace the sources of information referenced in your work. It is
important to cite every piece of information obtained from another source,
regardless of whether it is paraphrased or quoted directly. Each citation in
the text must correspond to an entry in the reference list, and all items in
the reference list must be cited in the text. Ensure that there is no
discrepancy between the two.
In APA style, you use only the authors’ s u r n a m e s and the
publication year in in-text citations. There are two main methods for citing

someone’s work in the text. When paraphrasing or summarizing information,
include the author’s last name and the publication year in parentheses at
the end of the sentence (Author, Year).
In narrative citations, the authors’ surnames are integrated into the
sentence itself, indicating that you are referring to them directly. For
example:
Eccles (2016) argued that learner academic engagement

has a positive and significant relationship with academic
achievement and resilience.
ONE Author

Baker and Jarunthawatchai (2017) highlight the persistent

inadequacies in English proficiency among Thai students visà-vis their counterparts in other Southeast Asian nations.
TWO Authors

Dewaele et al. (2019) explained that cultivating learners’

positive psychological states seeks to take advantage of the
power of positive strengths to strike a balance by mitigating
the adverse effects.
3 or More Authors

RESEARCH WRITING

285

In parenthetical citations, the authors’ surnames are not included
in the sentence; instead, only the content of their work is referenced. The
citation should be placed at the end of the sentence or clause where their
information is used. The authors’ surnames are included in the parentheses
along with the other citation details:
A considerable proportion of non-native English speakers
employs the language for communication, particularly within
educational and professional milieus (Sharifian, 2017).
ONE Author

L2 grit has been reported to significantly predict language
lear ners’ willingness to communicate and language
achievement (Liu & Wang, 2021).
TWO Authors

The role of grit is an important factor that should not be
undervalued (Sudina et al., 2021).
3 or More Authors

286

RESEARCH WRITING

If you are citing multiple works within the same set of parentheses,
arrange your citations in the same order they appear in your reference list.
This means they should be in alphabetical order , and for works by the
same author, they should be listed from oldest to newest. Each citation
should be separated by a semicolon.
Teachers can help their learners by adjusting their lessons or
classroom environments by flourishing loving pedagogy and
encouraging them to learn without feeling under pressure
(Alrabai, 2022; Oladrostam et al., 2024; Sadeghi &
Pourbahram, 2024).

More Works

Multiple works by the same author in the same year
In your reference list, you should arrange the works alphabetically
by title (refer to the page on Reference Lists for further information). This
determines the order of references labeled as “a,” “b,” “c,” and so forth,
and you should cite them in the text accordingly:
This limitation reduces motivation, increases anxiety in
practical language use, and results in below-average
language skills (Lee, 2022a) . As noted by prior research
(Lee, 2022b), learners with less boredom or more enjoyment

show greater motivation and willingness to speak English.
Example

RESEARCH WRITING

287

Direct Citation : When directly quoting a source with quotation

marks, include the author’s last name, publication year, and page number(s)
f o r t h e q u o t e i n p a r e n t h e s e s a f t e r t h e q u o t e ( A u t h o r, Ye a r,
p. Page Number).
Enjoyment is described as a “complex emotion, capturing
interacting dimensions of the challenge and perceived ability
that reflect the human drive for success in the face of difficult
tasks” (Dewaele & MacIntyre, 2016, p. 217).
According to Newby (2010) , “convenience sampling is the
use of data sources that just happen to be around” based
on the convenience of the researcher (pp. 251-252).
Examples

Secondary Citation (works referred to in other works)
Academically, it is preferable to locate the original source and
reference that source directly. However, if you must quote a secondary
source, you should cite the original author of the quote along with the year
it was written, as well as the source where you found it. If you are unsure of
the year of the original citation, you can omit it. In the reference list, only
include the source that you actually read.
Wembley (1997, as cited in Olsen, 1999) argues that

impending fuel shortages ...
Wembley claimed that “fuel shortages are likely” (1997, as
cited in Olsen, 1999, pp. 10-12).

Some have noted that fuel shortages are probable in the
future (Wembley, 1997, as cited in Olsen, 1999).

288

RESEARCH WRITING

Tenses for an APA7 Referencing Style
Verb tenses play a significant role in academic writing, especially
when discussing research findings or literature. This section clarifies the
appropriate use of verb tenses in APA 7 referencing style, providing
guidance on when to use past, present, or future tenses in various sections
of your research paper.
In academic writing, particularly when adhering to the APA7
referencing style, the choice of tenses plays a crucial role in conveying
information accurately and maintaining consistency throughout the text.
Understanding the appropriate use of tenses enhances the clarity and
coherence of your writing, thereby facilitating comprehension for your
readers. In this section, you will explore the recommended tenses for
different elements of APA7 referencing.

1. Present Tense for General Statements: When discussing
established theories, stating general facts, or presenting the
findings of previous research, employ the present tense . For
instance, “Smith (2019) argues that...” or “The study demonstrates
that...”

2. Past Tense for Completed Actions: Describe actions that have
already been accomplished, such as research methods employed,
data collected, and conclusions drawn, using the past tense . For
example, “The participants were selected based on specific
criteria” or “The results indicated a significant correlation.”

3. Present Perfect for Recent Relevance: Use the present perfect
tense to indicate actions or findings with ongoing relevance to the
present. This tense is suitable for discussing recent research
developments or when emphasizing the current significance of past
events. For instance, “Recent studies have highlighted the
importance of...”

4. Future Tense for Proposals or Predictions: When outlining
future research plans, making predictions, or discussing hypothetical

RESEARCH WRITING

289

scenarios, employ the future tense . For example, “This study will
investigate...” or “The findings are expected to contribute to...”

5. Reporting Verbs in Present or Past Tense: When introducing
the work of others through citations or paraphrases, the choice of
reporting verb determines the tense. Use present tense reporting
verbs (e.g., “argues,” “claims,” “states”) for current or ongoing
ideas, and past tense reporting verbs (e.g., “argued,” “claimed,”
“stated”) for completed or historical perspectives.

Important Notes
1.

Consistency and Clarity: Maintain consistency in your use of

tenses throughout the text to avoid confusion. Switching
between tenses unnecessarily can disrupt the flow of your
writing and detract from its coherence. Additionally, consider
the temporal relationships between different sections of your
paper to ensure that the chosen tenses accurately reflect the
sequence of events or ideas being presented.
2.

Check APA7 Guidelines: While these guidelines provide

general recommendati ons for tense usage i n APA7
referencing style, it’s essential to consult the specific
requirements outlined in the APA Publication Manual or any
supplementary guidelines provided by your institution or
publisher.
By adhering to these guidelines for tense usage in APA7
referencing style, you can enhance the clarity, coherence, and
professionalism of your research writing, thereby effectively

communicating your ideas to your audience.

290

RESEARCH WRITING

References in Bibliography
The references or bibliography section of your research paper is
where you provide a comprehensive list of all the sources cited in your
work. This section explains how to format reference list entries according to
APA 7 guidelines. It covers various source types such as books, journal
articles, websites, and more, detailing the required information for each
type and the correct formatting.

Layout of page:
The reference list begins on a new page, following your research
paper and before any appendices. At the top of the page, center the word
“References” in bold. APA style does not require additional formatting for
the title of your reference page (such as underlining), but it is advisable to
confirm this with your advisor.
Each entry in the
reference list should have a
hanging indent , where the

first line of the entry is aligned
with the left margin, and all
subsequent lines are indented.
This format differs from the
paragraph structure used in
the body of your research
paper.

Figure 11.2 How to get the list indented
Tip:

To create a hanging indent easily, select your references and press
Ctrl + T on a PC or Command (⌘) + T on a Mac.

RESEARCH WRITING

291

Order of references:
•

For APA the reference list is arranged in alphabetical order of authors’
surnames.

•

Arrange by first author's surname, then by second author if you have
the same first author, etc..

•

If a reference has no author, list it alphabetically according to the title.
Ignore the words 'A', 'An' and 'The' at the beginning of a corporate
author or title for deciding where it fits alphabetically.

•

If there are two references by the same author, list them in order of
publication date with the older one first.
For example:

•

-

Imsa-ard, P. (n.d.)...

-

Imsa-ard, P. (2016)...

-

Imsa-ard, P. (2018a)....

If references by the same author have been published in the same
year, list them alphabetically by title. Use letters ‘a,’ ‘b,’ etc., after
the year to differentiate them, e.g., (2019a), (2019b).
o

N.B. If you have a complete date, only use the title to order the

references if the date is identical. Always use ‘a’, ‘b’, etc after
the year, if more than one work has been published by the
same author in the same year, as this is used in the in-text
referencing, e.g. (2019a, April 12), (2019b, March 23).

Automatic Citations by Google Scholar
Google Scholar is a widely used tool for finding previously

published academic work, including journal articles, conference papers,
theses, and dissertations. It offers a vast database of scholarly literature,
making it a valuable resource for researchers seeking relevant sources for
their studies. In addition to helping researchers discover relevant articles,
Google Scholar also provides a feature for automatically generating
citations.
While this feature can be convenient, it is essential to exercise
caution when relying on automatically generated citations. Google Scholar’s
citation tool may not always provide accurate or complete citations, so it is
advisable to double-check the correctness of citations before including
them in your research work. It is also recommended to follow the citation
style guidelines specified by your academic institution or publisher for
consistency and accuracy in your citations.

Step 1: Search for your interested articles. Then click ‘Cite’ under the one

you select.
